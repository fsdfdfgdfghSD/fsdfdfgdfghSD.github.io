NAME
       ppmtosixel - convert a portable pixmap into DEC sixel format

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtosixel [-raw] [-margin] [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable pixmap as input.  Produces sixel commands (SIX) as output.  The output is formatted for color printing, e.g. for a DEC LJ250 color inkjet printer.

       If  RGB  values  from  the PPM file do not have maxval=100, the RGB values are rescaled.  A printer control header and a color assignment table begin the SIX file.  Image data is written in a compressed format by de‐
       fault.  A printer control footer ends the image file.

OPTIONS
       -raw   If specified, each pixel will be explicitly described in the image file.  If -raw is not specified, output will default to compressed format in which identical adjacent pixels are replaced  by  "repeat  pixel"
              commands.  A raw file is often an order of magnitude larger than a compressed file and prints much slower.

       -margin
              If -margin is not specified, the image will be start at the left margin (of the window, paper, or whatever).  If -margin is specified, a 1.5 inch left margin will offset the image.

PRINTING
       Generally, sixel files must reach the printer unfiltered.  Use the lpr -x option or cat filename > /dev/tty0?.

BUGS
       Upon  rescaling, truncation of the least significant bits of RGB values may result in poor color conversion.  If the original PPM maxval was greater than 100, rescaling also reduces the image depth.  While the actual
       RGB values from the ppm file are more or less retained, the color palette of the LJ250 may not match the colors on your screen.  This seems to be a printer limitation.
