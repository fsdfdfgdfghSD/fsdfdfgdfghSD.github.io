NAME
       ppmtoxpm - convert a portable pixmap into an X11 pixmap

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtoxpm [-name=xpmname] [-rgb=rgb-textfile] [-alphamask=pgmfile] [ppmfile]

       Minimum unique abbrevations are acceptable.

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable pixmap as input.  Produces X11 pixmap (version 3) as output which can be loaded directly by the XPM library.

       For example, to convert the file "dot" (found in /usr/include/X11/bitmaps), from xbm to xpm one could specify

              xbmtopbm dot | ppmtoxpm -name dot

       or, with a rgb text file (in the local directory)

              xbmtopbm dot | ppmtoxpm -name dot -rgb rgb.txt

OPTIONS
       -name=xpmname
              The  -name option allows you to specify the prefix string which is printed in the resulting XPM output.  If not specified, will default to the filename (without extension) of the <ppmfile> argument.  If you do
              not specify -name or ppmfile, (i.e. your input is from Standad Input), the prefix string defaults to the string noname.

       rgb=rgb-textfile
              The -rgb option allows you to specify an X11 rgb text file for the lookup of color name mnemonics.  This rgb text file is typically the /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt of the MIT X11 distribution, but any file using  the
              same  format  may  be  used.  When specified and a RGB value from the ppm input matches a RGB value from the <rgb-textfile>, then the corresponding color name mnemonic is printed in the XPM's colormap.  If you
              don't specify -rgb or if the RGB values don't match, then ppmtoxpm produces the color specifications in the #RGB, #RRGGBB, #RRRGGGBBB, or #RRRRGGGGBBBB hexadecimal format.

       -alphamask=pgmfile
              This option names a PGM file to use as an alpha (transparency) mask.  The file must contain an image the same dimensions as the input image.  ppmtoxpm marks as transparent any pixel whose position in the alpha
              mask image is at most half white.

              If you don't specify -alphamask, ppmtoxpm makes all pixels in the output opaque.

              ppmcolormask  is one way to generate an alpha mask file.  You might also generate it by extracting transparency information from an XPM file with the -alphaout option to xpmtoppm.  There are similar options on
              other Netpbm converters that convert from formats that include transparency information too.

LIMITATIONS
       An option to match the closest (rather than exact) color name mnemonic from the rgb text would be a desirable enhancement.

       Truncation of the least significant bits of a RGB value may result in nonexact matches when performing color name mnemonic lookups.
