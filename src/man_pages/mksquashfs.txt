NAME
       mksquashfs - tool to create and append to squashfs filesystems

SYNOPSIS
       mksquashfs SOURCE [SOURCE2 ...] DESTINATION [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       Squashfs  is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux. It uses zlib compression to compress both files, inodes and directories. Inodes in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimize data
       overhead. Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of 64K.

       Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in constrained block device/memory systems (e.g. embedded systems) where low  overhead
       is needed.

OPTIONS
   Filesystem build options
       -comp COMPRESSION
           select COMPRESSION compression. Compressors available: gzip (default), lzo, xz.

       -b BLOCK_SIZE
           set data block to BLOCK_SIZE. Default 131072 bytes.

       -no-exports
           don't make the filesystem exportable via NFS.

       -no-sparse
           don't detect sparse files.

       -no-xattrs
           don't store extended attributes.

       -xattrs
           store extended attributes (default).

       -noI
           do not compress inode table.

       -noD
           do not compress data blocks.

       -noF
           do not compress fragment blocks.

       -noX
           do not compress extended attributes.

       -no-fragments
           do not use fragments.

       -always-use-fragments
           use fragment blocks for files larger than block size.

       -no-duplicates
           do not perform duplicate checking.

       -all-root
           make all files owned by root.

       -force-uid uid
           set all file uids to uid.

       -force-gid gid
           set all file gids to gid.

       -nopad
           do not pad filesystem to a multiple of 4K.

       -keep-as-directory
           if one source directory is specified, create a root directory containing that directory, rather than the contents of the directory.

   Filesystem filter options
       -p PSEUDO_DEFINITION
           Add pseudo file definition.

       -pf PSEUDO_FILE
           Add list of pseudo file definitions.

       -sort SORT_FILE
           sort files according to priorities in SORT_FILE. One file or dir with priority per line. Priority -32768 to 32767, default priority 0.

       -ef EXCLUDE_FILE
           list of exclude dirs/files. One per line.

       -wildcards
           Allow extended shell wildcards (globbing) to be used in exclude dirs/files

       -regex
           Allow POSIX regular expressions to be used in exclude dirs/files.

   Filesystem append options
       -noappend
           do not append to existing filesystem.

       -root-becomes NAME
           when appending source files/directories, make the original root become a subdirectory in the new root called NAME, rather than adding the new source items to the original root.

   Mksquashfs runtime options:
       -version
           print version, licence and copyright message.

       -recover NAME
           recover filesystem data using recovery file NAME.

       -no-recovery
           don't generate a recovery file.

       -info
           print files written to filesystem.

       -no-progress
           don't display the progress bar.

       -processors NUMBER
           Use NUMBER processors. By default will use number of processors available.

       -read-queue SIZE
           Set input queue to SIZE Mbytes. Default 64 Mbytes.

       -write-queue SIZE
           Set output queue to SIZE Mbytes. Default 512 Mbytes.

       -fragment-queue SIZE
           Set fragment queue to SIZE Mbytes. Default 64 Mbytes.

   Miscellaneous options
       -root-owned
           alternative name for -all-root.

       -noInodeCompression
           alternative name for -noI.

       -noDataCompression
           alternative name for -noD.

       -noFragmentCompression
           alternative name for -noF.

       -noXattrCompression
           alternative name for -noX.

   Compressors available and compressor specific options
       gzip (no options) (default)

       lzo (no options)

       xz

       -Xbcj filter1,filter2,...,filterN
           Compress using filter1,filter2,...,filterN in turn (in addition to no filter), and choose the best compression. Available filters: x86, arm, armthumb, powerpc, sparc, ia64.

       -Xdict-size DICT_SIZE
           Use  DICT_SIZE as the XZ dictionary size. The dictionary size can be specified as a percentage of the block size, or as an absolute value. The dictionary size must be less than or equal to the block size and 8192
           bytes or larger. It must also be storable in the xz header as either 2^n or as 2^n+2^(n+1). Example dict-sizes are 75%, 50%, 37.5%, 25%, or 32K, 16K, 8K etc.
