NAME
       ppmtorgb3 - separate a portable pixmap into three portable graymaps

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtorgb3 [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable pixmap as input.  Writes three portable graymaps as output, one each for red, green, and blue.

       The  output  filenames are constructed by taking the input filename, stripping off any extension, and appending ".red", ".grn", and ".blu".  For example, separating lenna.ppm would result in lenna.red, lenna.grn, and
       lenna.blu.  If the input comes from stdin, the names are noname.red, noname.grn, and noname.blu.
