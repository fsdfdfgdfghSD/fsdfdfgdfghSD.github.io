NAME
       chvt - change foreground virtual terminal

SYNOPSIS
       chvt [option...]  N

DESCRIPTION
       The  command chvt N makes /dev/ttyN the foreground terminal.  (The corresponding screen is created if it did not exist yet.  To get rid of unused VTs, use deallocvt(1).)  The key combination (Ctrl-)LeftAlt-FN (with N
       in the range 1-12) usually has a similar effect.

OPTIONS
       -V, --version
              print program version and exit.

       -h, --help
              show this text and exit.
