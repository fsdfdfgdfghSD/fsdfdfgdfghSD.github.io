NAME
       on_ac_power - test whether computer is running on AC power

SYNOPSIS
       on_ac_power

DESCRIPTION
       on_ac_power checks whether the system is running on abundant power (such as AC mains, an USB charger, etc), as opposed to battery power.

OPTIONS
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       0 (true)  System is on mains power
       1 (false) System is not on mains power
       255 (false)    Power status could not be determined

CAVEATS
       The  vast  majority  of desktops and servers have no power sensors, thus they return 255 "unknown"; for most purposes you'd want to consider this answer to imply mains power â€” note that 255 evaluates as false for the
       shell.

       This program currently provides only information known to the kernel; it doesn't (yet?) query userspace daemons such as nut which may provide further information.
