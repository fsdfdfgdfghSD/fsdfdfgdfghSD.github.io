NAME
       systemd-delta - Find overridden configuration files

SYNOPSIS
       systemd-delta [OPTIONS...] [PREFIX[/SUFFIX]|SUFFIX...]

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-delta may be used to identify and compare configuration files that override other configuration files. Files in /etc/ have highest priority, files in /run/ have the second highest priority, ..., files in
       /usr/lib/ have lowest priority. Files in a directory with higher priority override files with the same name in directories of lower priority. In addition, certain configuration files can have ".d" directories which
       contain "drop-in" files with configuration snippets which augment the main configuration file. "Drop-in" files can be overridden in the same way by placing files with the same name in a directory of higher priority
       (except that, in case of "drop-in" files, both the "drop-in" file name and the name of the containing directory, which corresponds to the name of the main configuration file, must match). For a fuller explanation,
       see systemd.unit(5).

       The command line argument will be split into a prefix and a suffix. Either is optional. The prefix must be one of the directories containing configuration files (/etc/, /run/, /lib/, ...). If it is given, only
       overriding files contained in this directory will be shown. Otherwise, all overriding files will be shown. The suffix must be a name of a subdirectory containing configuration files like tmpfiles.d, sysctl.d or
       systemd/system. If it is given, only configuration files in this subdirectory (across all configuration paths) will be analyzed. Otherwise, all configuration files will be analyzed. If the command line argument is
       not given at all, all configuration files will be analyzed. See below for some examples.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       -t, --type=
           When listing the differences, only list those that are asked for. The list itself is a comma-separated list of desired difference types.

           Recognized types are:

           masked
               Show masked files

           equivalent
               Show overridden files that while overridden, do not differ in content.

           redirected
               Show files that are redirected to another.

           overridden
               Show overridden, and changed files.

           extended
               Show *.conf files in drop-in directories for units.

           unchanged
               Show unmodified files too.

       --diff=
           When showing modified files, when a file is overridden show a diff as well. This option takes a boolean argument. If omitted, it defaults to true.

       -h, --help
           Print a short help text and exit.

       --version
           Print a short version string and exit.

       --no-pager
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

EXAMPLES
       To see all local configuration:

           systemd-delta

       To see all runtime configuration:

           systemd-delta /run

       To see all system unit configuration changes:

           systemd-delta systemd/system

       To see all runtime "drop-in" changes for system units:

           systemd-delta --type=extended /run/systemd/system

EXIT STATUS
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
