NAME
       sha512sum - compute and check SHA512 message digest

SYNOPSIS
       sha512sum [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Print or check SHA512 (512-bit) checksums.

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       -b, --binary
              read in binary mode

       -c, --check
              read SHA512 sums from the FILEs and check them

       --tag  create a BSD-style checksum

       -t, --text
              read in text mode (default)

       -z, --zero
              end each output line with NUL, not newline, and disable file name escaping

   The following five options are useful only when verifying checksums:
       --ignore-missing
              don't fail or report status for missing files

       --quiet
              don't print OK for each successfully verified file

       --status
              don't output anything, status code shows success

       --strict
              exit non-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines

       -w, --warn
              warn about improperly formatted checksum lines

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The  sums  are  computed as described in FIPS-180-2.  When checking, the input should be a former output of this program.  The default mode is to print a line with checksum, a space, a character indicating input mode
       ('*' for binary, ' ' for text or where binary is insignificant), and name for each FILE.

       Note: There is no difference between binary mode and text mode on GNU systems.
