NAME
       yuvsplittoppm - convert a Y- and a U- and a V-file into a portable pixmap

SYNOPSIS
       yuvsplittoppm basename width height [-ccir601]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads three files, containing the YUV components, as input.  These files are basename.Y, basename.U, and basename.V.  Produces a portable pixmap on stdout.

       Since the YUV files are raw files, the dimensions width and height must be specified on the command line.

OPTIONS
       -ccir601
              Assumes that the YUV triplets are scaled into the smaller range of the CCIR 601 (MPEG) standard. Else, the JFIF (JPEG) standard is assumed.
