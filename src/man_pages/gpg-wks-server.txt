NAME
       gpg-wks-server - Server providing the Web Key Service

SYNOPSIS
       gpg-wks-server [options] --receive
       gpg-wks-server [options] --cron
       gpg-wks-server [options] --list-domains
       gpg-wks-server [options] --check-key user-id
       gpg-wks-server [options] --install-key file user-id
       gpg-wks-server [options] --remove-key user-id
       gpg-wks-server [options] --revoke-key user-id

DESCRIPTION
       The  gpg-wks-server  is a server site implementation of the Web Key Service.  It receives requests for publication, sends confirmation requests, receives confirmations, and published the key.  It also has features to
       ease the setup and maintenance of a Web Key Directory.

       When used with the command --receive a single Web Key Service mail is processed.  Commonly this command is used with the option --send to directly send the crerated mails back.  See below for an installation example.

       The command --cron is used for regualr cleanup tasks.  For example non-confirmed requested should be removed after their expire time.  It is best to run this command once a day from a cronjob.

       The command --list-domains prints all configured domains.  Further it creates missing directories for the configuration and prints warnings pertaining to problems in the configuration.

       The command --check-key (or just --check) checks whether a key with the given user-id is installed.  The process returns success in this case; to also print a diagnostic use the option -v.  If  the  key  is  not  in‐
       stalled a diagnostic is printed and the process returns failure; to suppress the diagnostic, use option -q.  More than one user-id can be given; see also option with-file.

       The command --install-key manually installs a key into the WKD.  The arguments are a file with the keyblock and the user-id to install.  If the first argument resembles a fingerprint the key is taken from the current
       keyring; to force the use of a file, prefix the first argument with "./".  If no arguments are given the parameters are read from stdin; the expected format are lines with the fingerprint and the mailbox separated by
       a space.

       The  command  --remove-key uninstalls a key from the WKD.  The process returns success in this case; to also print a diagnostic, use option -v.  If the key is not installed a diagnostic is printed and the process re‐
       turns failure; to suppress the diagnostic, use option -q.

       The command --revoke-key is not yet functional.

OPTIONS
       gpg-wks-server understands these options:

       -C dir
       --directory dir
              Use dir as top level directory for domains.  The default is ‘/var/lib/gnupg/wks’.

       --from mailaddr
              Use mailaddr as the default sender address.

       --header name=value
              Add the mail header "name: value" to all outgoing mails.

       --send Directly send created mails using the sendmail command.  Requires installation of that command.

       -o file
       --output file
              Write the created mail also to file. Note that the value - for file would write it to stdout.

       --with-dir
              When used with the command --list-domains print for each installed domain the domain name and its directory name.

       --with-file
              When used with the command --check-key print for each user-id, the address, 'i' for installed key or 'n' for not installed key, and the filename.

       --verbose
              Enable extra informational output.

       --quiet
              Disable almost all informational output.

       --version
              Print version of the program and exit.

       --help Display a brief help page and exit.

EXAMPLES
       The Web Key Service requires a working directory to store keys pending for publication.  As root create a working directory:

           # mkdir /var/lib/gnupg/wks
           # chown webkey:webkey /var/lib/gnupg/wks
           # chmod 2750 /var/lib/gnupg/wks

       Then under your webkey account create directories for all your domains.  Here we do it for "example.net":

           $ mkdir /var/lib/gnupg/wks/example.net

       Finally run

           $ gpg-wks-server --list-domains

       to create the required sub-directories with the permissions set correctly.  For each domain a submission address needs to be configured.  All service mails are directed to that address.  It can be  the  same  address
       for all configured domains, for example:

           $ cd /var/lib/gnupg/wks/example.net
           $ echo key-submission@example.net >submission-address

       The protocol requires that the key to be published is send with an encrypted mail to the service.  Thus you need to create a key for the submission address:

           $ gpg --batch --passphrase '' --quick-gen-key key-submission@example.net
           $ gpg -K key-submission@example.net

       The output of the last command looks similar to this:

           sec   rsa3072 2016-08-30 [SC]
                 C0FCF8642D830C53246211400346653590B3795B
           uid           [ultimate] key-submission@example.net
           ssb   rsa3072 2016-08-30 [E]

       Take the fingerprint from that output and manually publish the key:

           $ gpg-wks-server --install-key C0FCF8642D830C53246211400346653590B3795B \
           >                key-submission@example.net

       Finally  that  submission address needs to be redirected to a script running gpg-wks-server.  The procmail command can be used for this: Redirect the submission address to the user "webkey" and put this into webkey's
       ‘.procmailrc’:

         :0
         * !^From: webkey@example.net
         * !^X-WKS-Loop: webkey.example.net
         |gpg-wks-server -v --receive \
              --header X-WKS-Loop=webkey.example.net \
              --from webkey@example.net --send
