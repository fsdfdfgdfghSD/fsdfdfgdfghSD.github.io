NAME
       scriptlive - re-run session typescripts, using timing information

SYNOPSIS
       scriptlive [options] [-t] timingfile [-I|-B] typescript

DESCRIPTION
       This program re-runs a typescript, using stdin typescript and timing information to ensure that input happens in the same rhythm as it originally appeared when the script was recorded.

       The session is executed in a newly created pseudoterminal with the user’s $SHELL (or defaults to /bin/bash).

       Be careful! Do not forget that the typescript may contains arbitrary commands. It is recommended to use "scriptreplay --stream in --log-in typescript" (or with --log-io instead of --log-in) to verify the typescript
       before it is executed by scriptlive.

       The timing information is what script1 outputs to file specified by --log-timing. The typescript has to contain stdin information and it is what script1 outputs to file specified by --log-in or --log-io.

OPTIONS
       -I, --log-in file
           File containing script's terminal input.

       -B, --log-io file
           File containing script's terminal output and input.

       -t, --timing file
           File containing script's timing output. This option overrides old-style arguments.

       -T, --log-timing file
           Aliased to -t, maintained for compatibility with script(1) command-line options.

       -d, --divisor number
           Speed up the replay displaying this number of times. The argument is a floating-point number. It’s called divisor because it divides the timings by this factor. This option overrides old-style arguments.

       -m, --maxdelay number
           Set the maximum delay between updates to number of seconds. The argument is a floating-point number. This can be used to avoid long pauses in the typescript replay.

       -V, --version
           Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

EXAMPLES
           % script --log-timing file.tm --log-in script.in
           Script started, file is script.out
           % date
           <etc, etc>
           % exit
           Script done, file is script.out
           % scriptlive --log-timing file.tm --log-in script.in
