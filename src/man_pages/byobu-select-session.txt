NAME
       byobu-select-session - select and connect to a byobu session

DESCRIPTION
       byobu-select-session  is  an  application that lists the available screen sessions running on the system, and prompts the user to select one.  The user also has the option to create a new Byobu session, or launch the
       default shell without Byobu.

       If an invalid selection is chosen 3 times in a row, the user is connected to the youngest session.

       By default, if only one session exists, the user is connected to that session, and if no sessions exist, a new session is created -- such that there is no interactive prompt in the  normal  behavior.   However,  some
       users may choose to always be prompted, by touching the file $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/.always-select.

       Note that BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR=$HOME/.byobu.

       Named sessions that begin with a "." are "hidden" from byobu-select-session(1).  This is useful, for instance, if you do not want a session to be automatically selected at login.  Example:
         byobu -S .hidden

FILES
       $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/.always-select
