NAME
       ucfr - Update Configuration File Registry:  associate packages with configuration files

SYNOPSIS
       ucfr [options] <Package> <Path to configuration file>

DESCRIPTION
       Where  Package  is the package associated with the configuration file (and, in some sense, its owner), and Path to configuration file is the full path to the location (usually under /etc) where the configuration file
       lives, and is potentially modified by the end user. Please note that usually this means that we register actual files, and not symbolic links to files.  ucfr will follow symbolic links and  register  the  real  file,
       and not the symbolic link.

       This  script  maintains  an  association between configuration files and packages, and is meant to help provide facilities that dpkg provides conffiles for configuration files and not shipped in a Debian package, but
       handled by the postinst by ucf instead. This script is idempotent, associating a package to a file multiple times is not an error.  It is normally an error to try to associate a file which is already associated  with
       another package, but this can be overridden by using the --force option.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print a short usage message

       -n, --no-action
              Dry run. Print the actions that would be taken if the script is invoked, but take no action.

       -d [n], --debug [n]
              Set the debug level to the (optional) level n (n defaults to 1). This turns on copious debugging information.

       -p, --purge
              Removes all vestiges of the association between the named package and the configuration file from the registry. The association must already exist; if the configuration file is associated with some other pack‚Äê
              age, an error happens, unless the option --force is also given. In that case, the any associations for the configuration file are removed from the registry, whether or not the package name matches. This action
              is  idempotent, asking for an association to be purged multiple times does not result in an error, since attempting to remove an non-existent association is silently ignored unless the --verbose option is used
              (in which case it just issues a diagnostic).

       -v, --verbose
              Make the script be very verbose about setting internal variables.

       -f, --force
              This option forces operations requested even if the configuration file in consideration is owned by another package. This allows a package to hijack a configuration file from another package, or to  purge  the
              association between the file and some other package in the registry.

       --state-dir /path/to/dir
              Set the state directory to /path/to/dir instead of the default /var/lib/ucf.  Used mostly for testing.

USAGE
       The  most  common  case usage is pretty simple: a single line invocation in the postinst on configure, and another single line in the postrm to tell ucfr to forget about the association with the configuration file on
       purge (using the  --purge option) is all that is needed (assuming ucfr is still on the system).

FILES
       /var/lib/ucf/registry, and /var/lib/ucf/registry.X, where X is a small integer, where previous versions of the registry are stored.

       /etc/ucf.conf

EXAMPLES
       If the package foo wants to use ucfr to associate itself with a configuration file foo.conf, a simple invocation of ucfr in the postinst file is all that is needed:

       ucfr foo /etc/foo.conf

       On purge, one should tell ucf to forget about the file (see detailed examples in /usr/share/doc/ucf/examples):

       ucfr --purge foo /etc/foo.conf

       If you want to remove all the conf files for a given package foo, the simplest way is to use ucfq.  For example

       ucfq -w foo | cut -d : -f 1 | while read cfile ; do ucfr -v $cfile ; done
