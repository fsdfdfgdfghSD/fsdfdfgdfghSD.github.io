NAME
       ps2ps, eps2eps - Ghostscript PostScript "distiller"

SYNOPSIS
       ps2ps [ options ] input output.ps
       eps2eps [ options ] input output.eps

DESCRIPTION
       ps2ps uses gs(1) to convert PostScript(tm) or PDF(tm) file "input" to simpler, normalized and (usually) faster PostScript in "output.ps".  The output is level 2 DSC 3.0 conforming PostScript.

       eps2eps performs the equivalent optimization, creating Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files. NB, despite the name, the input need not be an EPS file, PostScript or indeed PDF files are equally acceptable.

       Both accept any general Ghostscript command line options, and options specific to the ps2write and eps2write devices.

FILES
       Run "gs -h" to find the location of Ghostscript documentation on your system, from which you can get more details.
