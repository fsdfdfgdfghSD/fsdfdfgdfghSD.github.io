NAME
       ppmrainbow - Generate a rainbow

SYNOPSIS
       ppmrainbow [-width=number] [-height=number]
       [-tmpdir=directory] [-verbose] color ...

       All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.  You may use two hyphens instead of one to designate an option.  You may use either white space or equals signs between an option name and its value.

DESCRIPTION
       ppmrainbow  generates  a  PPM  image that fades from one color to another to another from left to right, like a rainbow.  The colors are those you specify on the command line, in that order.  The first color is added
       again on the right end of the image.

       If you want a vertical or other non-horizontal rainbow, run the output through pnmrotate.

       One use for such a rainbow is to compose it with another image under an alpha mask in order to add a rainbow area to another image.  In fact, you can make rainbow-colored text by using pbmtext, pnmcomp, and  ppmrain‚Äê
       bow.

OPTIONS
       -width number
              The width in pixels of the output image.

              Default is 600.

       -height number
              The height in pixels of the output image.

              Default is 8.

       -tmpdir
              The directory specification of the directory ppmrainbow is to use for temporary files.

              Default is the value of the TMPDIR environment variable, or /tmp if TMPDIR is not set.

       -verbose
              Print the "commands" (invocations of other Netpbm programs) that ppmrainbow uses to create the image.
