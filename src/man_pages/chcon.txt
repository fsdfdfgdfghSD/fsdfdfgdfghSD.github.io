NAME
       chcon - change file security context

SYNOPSIS
       chcon [OPTION]... CONTEXT FILE...
       chcon [OPTION]... [-u USER] [-r ROLE] [-l RANGE] [-t TYPE] FILE...
       chcon [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Change the SELinux security context of each FILE to CONTEXT.  With --reference, change the security context of each FILE to that of RFILE.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       --dereference
              affect the referent of each symbolic link (this is the default), rather than the symbolic link itself

       -h, --no-dereference
              affect symbolic links instead of any referenced file

       -u, --user=USER
              set user USER in the target security context

       -r, --role=ROLE
              set role ROLE in the target security context

       -t, --type=TYPE
              set type TYPE in the target security context

       -l, --range=RANGE
              set range RANGE in the target security context

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat '/' specially (the default)

       --preserve-root
              fail to operate recursively on '/'

       --reference=RFILE
              use RFILE's security context rather than specifying a CONTEXT value

       -R, --recursive
              operate on files and directories recursively

       -v, --verbose
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       The following options modify how a hierarchy is traversed when the -R option is also specified.  If more than one is specified, only the final one takes effect.

       -H     if a command line argument is a symbolic link to a directory, traverse it

       -L     traverse every symbolic link to a directory encountered

       -P     do not traverse any symbolic links (default)

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit
