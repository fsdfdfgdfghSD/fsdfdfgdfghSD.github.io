NAME
       debconf-show - query the debconf database

SYNOPSIS
        debconf-show packagename [...] [--db=dbname]
        debconf-show --listowners [--db=dbname]
        debconf-show --listdbs

DESCRIPTION
       debconf-show lets you query the debconf database in different ways.

       The most common use is "debconf-show packagename", which displays all items in the debconf database owned by a given package, and their current values.  Questions that have been asked already are prefixed with an
       '*'.

       This can be useful as a debugging aid, and especially handy in bug reports involving a package's use of debconf.

OPTIONS
       --db=dbname
           Specify the database to query. By default, debconf-show queries the main database.

       --listowners
           Lists all owners of questions in the database. Generally an owner is equivalent to a debian package name.

       --listdbs
           Lists all available databases.
