NAME
       pjtoppm - convert an HP PaintJet file to a portable pixmap

SYNOPSIS
       pjtoppm [paintjet]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  an  HP PaintJet file as input and converts it into a portable pixmap.  This was a quick hack to save some trees, and it only handles a small subset of the paintjet commands.  In particular, it will only handle
       enough commands to convert most raster image files.
