NAME
       fusermount3 - mount and unmount FUSE filesystems

SYNOPSIS
       fusermount3 [OPTIONS] MOUNTPOINT

DESCRIPTION
       Filesystem  in  Userspace  (FUSE)  is a simple interface for userspace programs to export a virtual filesystem to the Linux kernel. It also aims to provide a secure method for non privileged users to create and mount
       their own filesystem implementations.

       fusermount3 is a program to mount and unmount FUSE filesystems. It should be called directly only for unmounting FUSE file systems. To allow mounting and unmounting by unprivileged users, fusermount3 needs to be  in‚Äê
       stalled set-uid root.
