NAME
       byobu-keybindings - toggle on/off Byobu's keybindings

SYNOPSIS
       byobu-keybindings

DESCRIPTION
       byobu-keybindings toggles on and off Byobu's keybindings in the current tmux(1) or screen(1) session.  It will only operate against the current session.

       This executable is provided as an alternative to pressing <Shift>-F12, and is useful in environments where <Shift>-F12 does not work (e.g., on the Linux console TTY).

       Some Byobu users toggle these keybindings when they interfere with other programs using the same keybindings (e.g., mc(1)).
