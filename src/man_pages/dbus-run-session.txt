DBUS-RUN-SESSION(1)                                                                                      User Commands                                                                                      DBUS-RUN-SESSION(1)

NAME
       dbus-run-session - start a process as a new D-Bus session

SYNOPSIS
       dbus-run-session [--config-file FILENAME] [--dbus-daemon BINARY] [--] PROGRAM [ARGUMENTS...]

       dbus-run-session --help

       dbus-run-session --version

DESCRIPTION
       dbus-run-session is used to start a session bus instance of dbus-daemon from a shell script, and start a specified program in that session. The dbus-daemon will run for as long as the program does, after which it
       will terminate.

       One use is to run a shell with its own dbus-daemon in a text-mode or SSH session, and have the dbus-daemon terminate automatically on leaving the sub-shell, like this:

       dbus-run-session -- bash

       or to replace the login shell altogether, by combining dbus-run-session with the exec builtin:

       exec dbus-run-session -- bash

       Another use is to run regression tests and similar things in an isolated D-Bus session, to avoid either interfering with the "real" D-Bus session or relying on there already being a D-Bus session active, for
       instance:

       dbus-run-session -- make check

       or (in automake(1)):

             AM_TESTS_ENVIRONMENT = export MY_DEBUG=all;
             LOG_COMPILER = dbus-run-session
             AM_LOG_FLAGS = --

OPTIONS
       --config-file=FILENAME, --config-file FILENAME
           Pass --config-file=FILENAME to the bus daemon, instead of passing it the --session argument. See dbus-daemon(1).

       --dbus-daemon=BINARY, --dbus-daemon BINARY
           Run BINARY as dbus-daemon(1), instead of searching the PATH in the usual way for an executable called dbus-daemon.

       --help
           Print usage information and exit.

       --version
           Print the version of dbus-run-session and exit.

EXIT STATUS
       dbus-run-session exits with the exit status of PROGRAM, 0 if the --help or --version options were used, 127 on an error within dbus-run-session itself, or 128+n if the PROGRAM was killed by signal n.

ENVIRONMENT
       PATH is searched to find PROGRAM, and (if the --dbus-daemon option is not used or its argument does not contain a / character) to find dbus-daemon.

       The session bus' address is made available to PROGRAM in the environment variable DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS.

       The variables DBUS_SESSION_BUS_PID, DBUS_SESSION_BUS_WINDOWID, DBUS_STARTER_BUS_TYPE and DBUS_STARTER_ADDRESS are removed from the environment, if present.

BUGS
       Please send bug reports to the D-Bus mailing list or bug tracker, see http://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/
