NAME
       unsquashfs - tool to uncompress squashfs filesystems

SYNOPSIS
       unsquashfs [OPTIONS] FILESYSTEM [directories or files to extract]

DESCRIPTION
       Squashfs  is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux. It uses zlib compression to compress both files, inodes and directories. Inodes in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimize data
       overhead. Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of 64K.

       Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in constrained block device/memory systems (e.g. embedded systems) where low  overhead
       is needed.

OPTIONS
       -v, -version
           print version, licence and copyright information.

       -d PATHNAME, -dest PATHNAME
           unsquash to PATHNAME, default "squashfs-root".

       -n, -no-progress
           don't display the progress bar.

       -no, -no-xattrs
           don't extract xattrs in file system.

       -x, -xattrs
           extract xattrs in file system (default).

       -p NUMBER, -processors NUMBER
           use NUMBER processors. By default will use number of processors available.

       -i, -info
           print files as they are unsquashed.

       -li, -linfo
           print files as they are unsquashed with file attributes (like ls -l output).

       -l, -ls
           list filesystem, but don't unsquash.

       -ll, -lls
           list filesystem with file attributes (like ls -l output), but don't unsquash.

       -nl, -nls
           list filesystem with file attributes (like ls -n output), but don't unsquash.

       -f, -force
           if file already exists then overwrite.

       -s, -stat
           display filesystem superblock information.

       -e EXTRACT_FILE, -ef EXTRACT_FILE
           list of directories or files to extract. One per line.

       -da SIZE, -data-queue SIZE
           Set data queue to SIZE Mbytes. Default 256 Mbytes.

       -fr SIZE, -frag-queue SIZE
           Set fragment queue to SIZE Mbytes. Default 256 Mbytes.

       -r, -regex
           treat extract names as POSIX regular expressions rather than use the default shell wildcard expansion (globbing).

   Decompressors available
       gzip

       lzo

       xz
