NAME
       pnmfile - describe a portable anymap

SYNOPSIS
       pnmfile [-allimages] [pnmfile ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads one or more Netpbm files as input.  Writes out short descriptions of the image type, size, etc.  This is mostly for use in shell scripts, so the format is not particularly pretty.

OPTIONS
       -allimages
              Describe every image in each input file.  Without this option, pnmfile describes only the first image in each input file.  Note that before July 2000, a file could not contain more than one image and many pro‚Äê
              grams ignore all but the first.

SEE ALSO
