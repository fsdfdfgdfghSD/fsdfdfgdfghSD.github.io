NAME
       memusagestat - generate graphic from memory profiling data

SYNOPSIS
       memusagestat [option]... datafile [outfile]

DESCRIPTION
       memusagestat creates a PNG file containing a graphical representation of the memory profiling data in the file datafile; that file is generated via the -d (or --data) option of memusage(1).

       The red line in the graph shows the heap usage (allocated memory) and the green line shows the stack usage.  The x-scale is either the number of memory-handling function calls or (if the -t option is specified) time.

OPTIONS
       -o file, --output=file
              Name of the output file.

       -s string, --string=string
              Use string as the title inside the output graph.

       -t, --time
              Use time (rather than number of function calls) as the scale for the X axis.

       -T, --total
              Also draw a graph of total memory consumption.

       -x size, --x-size=size
              Make the output graph size pixels wide.

       -y size, --y-size=size
              Make the output graph size pixels high.

       -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Print version information and exit.
