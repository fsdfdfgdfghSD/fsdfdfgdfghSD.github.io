NAME
       colcrt - filter nroff output for CRT previewing

SYNOPSIS
       colcrt [options] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       colcrt provides virtual half-line and reverse line feed sequences for terminals without such capability, and on which overstriking is destructive. Half-line characters and underlining (changed to dashing `-') are
       placed on new lines in between the normal output lines.

OPTIONS
       -, --no-underlining
           Suppress all underlining. This option is especially useful for previewing allboxed tables from tbl(1).

       -2, --half-lines
           Causes all half-lines to be printed, effectively double spacing the output. Normally, a minimal space output format is used which will suppress empty lines. The program never suppresses two consecutive empty
           lines, however. The -2 option is useful for sending output to the line printer when the output contains superscripts and subscripts which would otherwise be invisible.

       -V, --version
           Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

HISTORY
       The colcrt command appeared in 3.0BSD.

BUGS
       Should fold underlines onto blanks even with the '-' option so that a true underline character would show.

       Canâ€™t back up more than 102 lines.

       General overstriking is lost; as a special case '|' overstruck with '-' or underline becomes '+'.

       Lines are trimmed to 132 characters.

       Some provision should be made for processing superscripts and subscripts in documents which are already double-spaced.

EXAMPLES
       A typical use of colcrt would be:

          tbl exum2.n | nroff -ms | colcrt - | more
