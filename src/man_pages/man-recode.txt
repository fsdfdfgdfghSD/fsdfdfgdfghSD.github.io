NAME
       man-recode - convert manual pages to another encoding

SYNOPSIS
       man-recode -t to-code {--suffix=suffix|--in-place} [-dqhV] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       man-recode  converts  multiple  manual  pages  from one encoding to another, guessing the appropriate input encoding for each one.  It is useful when permanently recoding pages written in legacy character sets, or in
       build systems that need to recode a set of pages to a single common encoding (usually UTF-8) for installation.  When converting many manual pages, this program is much faster than running man --recode or  manconv  on
       each page.

       If an encoding declaration is found on the first line of a manual page, then that declaration is used as the input encoding for that page.  Failing that, the input encoding is guessed based on the file name.

       Encoding declarations have the following form:

              '\" -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-

       or (if manual page preprocessors are also to be declared):

              '\" t -*- coding: ISO-8859-1 -*-

OPTIONS
       -t encoding, --to-code=encoding
              Convert manual pages to encoding.

       --suffix=suffix
              Form each output file name by appending suffix to the input file name, after removing any compression extension.

       --in-place
              Overwrite each input file with the output, after removing any compression extension.

       -q, --quiet
              Do not issue error messages when the page cannot be converted.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -h, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.
