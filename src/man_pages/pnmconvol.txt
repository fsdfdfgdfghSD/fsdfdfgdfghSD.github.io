NAME
       pnmconvol - general MxN convolution on a portable anymap

SYNOPSIS
       pnmconvol convolutionfile [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads two portable anymaps as input.  Convolves the second using the first, and writes a portable anymap as output.

       Convolution  means  replacing  each pixel with a weighted average of the nearby pixels.  The weights and the area to average are determined by the convolution matrix.  The unsigned numbers in the convolution file are
       offset by -maxval/2 to make signed numbers, and then normalized, so the actual values in the convolution file are only relative.

       Here is a sample convolution file; it does a simple average of the nine immediate neighbors, resulting in a smoothed image:
           P2
           3 3
           18
           10 10 10
           10 10 10
           10 10 10

       To see how this works, do the above-mentioned offset: 10 - 18/2 gives 1.  The possible range of values is from 0 to 18, and after the offset that's -9 to 9.  The normalization step makes the range -1 to  1,  and  the
       values get scaled correspondingly so they become 1/9 - exactly what you want.  The equivalent matrix for 5x5 smoothing would have maxval 50 and be filled with 26.

       The  convolution  file  will  usually be a graymap, so that the same convolution gets applied to each color component.  However, if you want to use a pixmap and do a different convolution to different colors, you can
       certainly do that.

       At the edges of the convolved image, where the convolution matrix would extend over the edge of the image, pnmconvol just copies the input pixels directly to the output.
