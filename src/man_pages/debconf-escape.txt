DEBCONF-ESCAPE(1)                                                                                           Debconf                                                                                           DEBCONF-ESCAPE(1)

NAME
       debconf-escape - helper when working with debconf's escape capability

SYNOPSIS
        debconf-escape -e < unescaped-text
        debconf-escape -u < escaped-text

DESCRIPTION
       When debconf has the 'escape' capability set, it will expect commands you send it to have backslashes and newlines escaped (as "\\" and "\n" respectively) and will in turn escape backslashes and newlines in its
       replies. This can be used, for example, to substitute multi-line strings into templates, or to get multi-line extended descriptions reliably using "METAGET".
