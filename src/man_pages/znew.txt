NAME
       znew -   recompress .Z files to .gz files

SYNOPSIS
       znew [ -ftv9PK] [ name.Z ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Znew recompresses files from .Z (compress) format to .gz (gzip) format.  If you want to recompress a file already in gzip format, rename the file to force a .Z extension then apply znew.

OPTIONS
       -f     Force recompression from .Z to .gz format even if a .gz file already exists.

       -t     Tests the new files before deleting originals.

       -v     Verbose. Display the name and percentage reduction for each file compressed.

       -9     Use the slowest compression method (optimal compression).

       -P     Use pipes for the conversion to reduce disk space usage.

       -K     Keep a .Z file when it is smaller than the .gz file; implies -t.

SEE ALSO
       gzip(1), zmore(1), zdiff(1), zgrep(1), zforce(1), gzexe(1), compress(1)

BUGS
       If the -P option is used, znew does not maintain the timestamp if touch(1) does not support the -r option, and does not maintain permissions if chmod(1) does not support the --reference option.
