NAME
       fitstopnm - convert a FITS file into a portable anymap

SYNOPSIS
       fitstopnm [-image N] [-noraw] [-scanmax] [-printmax] [-min f] [-max f] [FITSfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a FITS file as input.  Produces a portable pixmap if the FITS file consists of 3 image planes (NAXIS = 3 and NAXIS3 = 3), a portable graymap if the FITS file consists of 2 image planes (NAXIS = 2), or whenever
       the -image flag is specified.  The results may need to be flipped top for bottom; if so, just pipe the output through pnmflip -tb.

OPTIONS
       The -image option is for FITS files with three axes.  The assumption is that the third axis is for multiple images, and this option lets you select which one you want.

       Flags -min and -max can be used to override the min and max values as read from the FITS header or the image data if no DATAMIN and DATAMAX keywords are found.  Flag -scanmax can be used to force the program to  scan
       the  data  even  when  DATAMIN  and DATAMAX are found in the header. If -printmax is specified, the program will just print the min and max values and quit.  Flag -noraw can be used to force the program to produce an
       ASCII portable anymap.

       The program will tell what kind of anymap is writing.  All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.

REFERENCES
       FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System.  A full description can be found in Astronomy & Astrophysics Supplement Series 44 (1981), page 363.
