NAME
       watchgnupg - Read and print logs from a socket

SYNOPSIS
       watchgnupg [--force] [--verbose] socketname

DESCRIPTION
       Most  of the main utilities are able to write their log files to a Unix Domain socket if configured that way.  watchgnupg is a simple listener for such a socket.  It ameliorates the output with a time stamp and makes
       sure that long lines are not interspersed with log output from other utilities.  This tool is not available for Windows.

       watchgnupg is commonly invoked as

         watchgnupg --force $(gpgconf --list-dirs socketdir)/S.log

OPTIONS
       watchgnupg understands these options:

       --force
              Delete an already existing socket file.

       --tcp n
              Instead of reading from a local socket, listen for connects on TCP port n.

       --time-only
              Do not print the date part of the timestamp.

       --verbose
              Enable extra informational output.

       --version
              Print version of the program and exit.

       --help Display a brief help page and exit.

EXAMPLES
         $ watchgnupg --force --time-only $(gpgconf --list-dirs socketdir)/S.log

       This waits for connections on the local socket (e.g. ‘/home/foo/.gnupg/S.log’) and shows all log entries.  To make this work the option log-file needs to be used with all modules which logs are to be shown.  The sug‐
       gested entry for the configuration files is:

         log-file socket://

       If  the default socket as given above and returned by "echo $(gpgconf --list-dirs socketdir)/S.log" is not desired an arbitrary socket name can be specified, for example ‘socket:///home/foo/bar/mysocket’.  For debug‐
       ging purposes it is also possible to do remote logging.  Take care if you use this feature because the information is send in the clear over the network.  Use this syntax in the conf files:

         log-file tcp://192.168.1.1:4711

       You may use any port and not just 4711 as shown above; only IP addresses are supported (v4 and v6) and no host names.  You need to start watchgnupg with the tcp option.  Note that under  Windows  the  registry  entry
       HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:DefaultLogFile can be used to change the default log output from stderr to whatever is given by that entry.  However the only useful entry is a TCP name for remote debugging.

       The full documentation for this tool is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If GnuPG and the info program are properly installed at your site, the command

         info gnupg

       should give you access to the complete manual including a menu structure and an index.
