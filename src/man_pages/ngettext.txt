NAME
       ngettext - translate message and choose plural form

SYNOPSIS
       ngettext [OPTION] [TEXTDOMAIN] MSGID MSGID-PLURAL COUNT

DESCRIPTION
       The  ngettext program translates a natural language message into the user's language, by looking up the translation in a message catalog, and chooses the appropriate plural form, which depends on the number COUNT and
       the language of the message catalog where the translation was found.

       Display native language translation of a textual message whose grammatical form depends on a number.

       -d, --domain=TEXTDOMAIN
              retrieve translated message from TEXTDOMAIN

       -c, --context=CONTEXT
              specify context for MSGID

       -e     enable expansion of some escape sequences

       -E     (ignored for compatibility)

       [TEXTDOMAIN]
              retrieve translated message from TEXTDOMAIN

       MSGID MSGID-PLURAL
              translate MSGID (singular) / MSGID-PLURAL (plural)

       COUNT  choose singular/plural form based on this value

   Informative output:
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -V, --version
              display version information and exit

       If the TEXTDOMAIN parameter is not given, the domain is determined from the environment variable TEXTDOMAIN.  If the message catalog is not found in the regular directory, another location can be specified  with  the
       environment variable TEXTDOMAINDIR.  Standard search directory: /usr/share/locale
