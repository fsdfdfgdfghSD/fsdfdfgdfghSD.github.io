NAME
       dpkg-realpath - print the resolved pathname with DPKG_ROOT support

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-realpath [option...] pathname

DESCRIPTION
       dpkg-realpath is a tool (since dpkg 1.20.1) to resolve a pathname, that takes the dpkg(1) root directory into account, either implicitly from the DPKG_ROOT environment variable or from the command-line --root or
       --instdir options, and returns an absolute pathname relative to the root directory.  The root directory must not be prefixed to the pathname to be resolved.

       This is intended to be used by other dpkg helpers, or by maintainer scripts instead of using realpath(1) or readlink(1) to canonicalize pathnames, as these latter commands do not support canonicalization relative to
       a different root than /.

OPTIONS
       -z, --zero
           Use a NUL byte to end output lines instead of a new line character (since dpkg 1.20.6).

       --instdir directory
       --root directory
           Set the root directory to directory, which is the base directory that pathnames get canonicalized against.  Defaults to «/».

       -?, --help
           Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
           Show the version and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       DPKG_ROOT
           If set and the --instdir or --root options have not been specified, it will be used as the filesystem root directory.

       DPKG_COLORS
           Sets the color mode.  The currently accepted values are: auto (default), always and never.

SEE ALSO
       realpath(1), readlink(1).
