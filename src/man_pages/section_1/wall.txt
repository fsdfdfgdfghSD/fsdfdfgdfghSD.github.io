NAME
       wall - write a message to all users

SYNOPSIS
       wall [-n] [-t timeout] [-g group] [message | file]

DESCRIPTION
       wall displays a message, or the contents of a file, or otherwise its standard input, on the terminals of all currently logged in users. The command will wrap lines that are longer than 79 characters. Short lines are
       whitespace padded to have 79 characters. The command will always put a carriage return and new line at the end of each line.

       Only the superuser can write on the terminals of users who have chosen to deny messages or are using a program which automatically denies messages.

       Reading from a file is refused when the invoker is not superuser and the program is set-user-ID or set-group-ID.

OPTIONS
       -n, --nobanner
           Suppress the banner.

       -t, --timeout timeout
           Abandon the write attempt to the terminals after timeout seconds. This timeout must be a positive integer. The default value is 300 seconds, which is a legacy from the time when people ran terminals over modem
           lines.

       -g, --group group
           Limit printing message to members of group defined as a group argument. The argument can be group name or GID.

       -V, --version
           Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

NOTES
       Some sessions, such as wdm(1x), that have in the beginning of utmp(5) ut_type data a ':' character will not get the message from wall. This is done to avoid write errors.

HISTORY
       A wall command appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.
