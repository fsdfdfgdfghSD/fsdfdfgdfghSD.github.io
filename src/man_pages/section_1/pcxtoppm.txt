NAME
       pcxtoppm - convert a PCX file into a portable pixmap

SYNOPSIS
       pcxtoppm [-stdpalette] [-verbose] [pcxfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a PCX file as input.  Produces a portable pixmap as output.  Supported PCX types are:

       Colormapped files with 2-16 colors.
              "Packed pixel" format (1, 2 or 4 bits/pixel, 1 plane) or bitplane format (1 bit/pixel, 1-4 planes).  The program checks the colormap and uses an internal one if the provided colormap is completely black.

       Colormapped files with 256 colors
              8 bits/pixel, 1 plane, colormap at the end of the file.

       24bit truecolor files
              24bit RGB: 8 bits/pixel, 3 planes.

       32bit truecolor files
              24bit RGB + 8bit intensity: 8 bits/pixel, 4 planes.

OPTIONS
       -stdpalette
              Enforce the use of the internal colormap for files with 16 colors or less.
