run-one(1)                                                                                                  run-one                                                                                                  run-one(1)

NAME
       run-one - run just one instance at a time of some command and unique set of arguments (useful for cronjobs, eg)

SYNOPSIS
       run-one COMMAND [ARGS]

       run-this-one COMMAND [ARGS]

       run-one-constantly COMMAND [ARGS]

       keep-one-running COMMAND [ARGS]

       run-one-until-success COMMAND [ARGS]

       run-one-until-failure COMMAND [ARGS]

DESCRIPTION
       run-one is a wrapper script that runs no more than one unique instance of some command with a unique set of arguments.

       This is often useful with cronjobs, when you want no more than one copy running at a time.

       run-this-one is exactly like run-one, except that it will use pgrep(1) and kill(1) to find and kill any running processes owned by the user and matching the target commands and arguments.  Note that run-this-one will
       block while trying to kill matching processes, until all matching processes are dead.

       run-one-constantly operates exactly like run-one except that it respawns "COMMAND [ARGS]" any time COMMAND exits (zero or non-zero).

       keep-one-running is an alias for run-one-constantly.

       run-one-until-success operates exactly like run-one-constantly except that it respawns "COMMAND [ARGS]" until COMMAND exits successfully (ie, exits zero).

       run-one-until-failure operates exactly like run-one-constantly except that it respawns "COMMAND [ARGS]" until COMMAND exits with failure (ie, exits non-zero).

EXAMPLE
       In one shell:

        $ run-one rsync -azP $HOME $USER@example.com:/srv/backup
        foouser/
        foouser/.bash_history
              40298 100%   37.13MB/s    0:00:00 (xfer#1, to-check=3509/3516)
        foouser/.viminfo
              20352 100%   98.39kB/s    0:00:00 (xfer#3, to-check=3478/3516)
        ...
        sent 746228 bytes  received 413059 bytes  36802.76 bytes/sec
        total size is 3732890955  speedup is 3219.99

       In another shell, while the first is still running:

        $ run-one rsync -azP $HOME $USER@example.com:/srv/backup
        $ echo $?
        1

       Another example...  In one shell:

        $ run-one top

       In another shell:

        $ run-one top
        $ echo $?
        1
        $ run-this-one top
        top - 17:15:36 up  1:43,  3 users,  load average: 1.05, 1.04, 1.00
        Tasks: 170 total,   1 running, 169 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
        ...

       And note that the process in the first shell was killed.

       You might want to keep one ssh connection up and running all the time, with:

        $ run-one-constantly ssh -N -C -L 3128:localhost:3128 -L 7778:localhost:7778 example.com &
