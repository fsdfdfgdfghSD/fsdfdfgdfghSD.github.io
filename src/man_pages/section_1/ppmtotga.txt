NAME
       ppmtotga - convert portable pixmap into a TrueVision Targa file

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtotga [-mono|-cmap|-rgb] [-norle] [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable pixmap as input.  Produces a TrueVision Targa file as output.

OPTIONS
       -mono  Forces Targa file to be of type 8 bit monochrome.  Input must be a portable bitmap or a portable graymap.

       -cmap  Forces Targa file to be of type 24 bit colormapped.  Input must be a portable bitmap, a portable graymap or a portable pixmap containing no more than 256 distinct colors.

       -rgb   Forces Targa file to be of type 24 bit unmapped color.

       -norle Disables run-length encoding, in case you have a Targa reader which can't read run-length encoded files.

       All  flags  can  be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.  If no file type is specified the most highly constained compatible type is used, where monochrome is more constained than colormapped which is in turn
       more constained than unmapped.

BUGS
       Does not support all possible Targa file types.  Should really be in PNM, not PPM.
