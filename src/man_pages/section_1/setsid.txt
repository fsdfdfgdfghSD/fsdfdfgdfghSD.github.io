NAME
       setsid - run a program in a new session

SYNOPSIS
       setsid [options] program [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       setsid runs a program in a new session. The command calls fork(2) if already a process group leader. Otherwise, it executes a program in the current process. This default behavior is possible to override by the
       --fork option.

OPTIONS
       -c, --ctty
           Set the controlling terminal to the current one.

       -f, --fork
           Always create a new process.

       -w, --wait
           Wait for the execution of the program to end, and return the exit status of this program as the exit status of setsid.

       -V, --version
           Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.
