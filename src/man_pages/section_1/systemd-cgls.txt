NAME
       systemd-cgls - Recursively show control group contents

SYNOPSIS
       systemd-cgls [OPTIONS...] [CGROUP...]

       systemd-cgls [OPTIONS...] --unit|--user-unit [UNIT...]

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-cgls recursively shows the contents of the selected Linux control group hierarchy in a tree. If arguments are specified, shows all member processes of the specified control groups plus all their subgroups and
       their members. The control groups may either be specified by their full file paths or are assumed in the systemd control group hierarchy. If no argument is specified and the current working directory is beneath the
       control group mount point /sys/fs/cgroup/, shows the contents of the control group the working directory refers to. Otherwise, the full systemd control group hierarchy is shown.

       By default, empty control groups are not shown.
