NAME
       systemd-path - List and query system and user paths

SYNOPSIS
       systemd-path [OPTIONS...] [NAME...]

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-path may be used to query system and user paths. The tool makes many of the paths described in file-hierarchy(7) available for querying.

       When invoked without arguments, a list of known paths and their current values is shown. When at least one argument is passed, the path with this name is queried and its value shown. The variables whose name begins
       with "search-" do not refer to individual paths, but instead to a list of colon-separated search paths, in their order of precedence.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       --suffix=
           Printed paths are suffixed by the specified string.

       -h, --help
           Print a short help text and exit.

       --version
           Print a short version string and exit.

EXIT STATUS
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
