NAME
       pbmtox10bm - convert a portable bitmap into an X10 bitmap

SYNOPSIS
       pbmtox10bm [pbmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable bitmap as input.  Produces an X10 bitmap as output.  This older format is maintained for compatibility.

       Note that there is no x10bmtopbm tool, because xbmtopbm can read both X11 and X10 bitmaps.
