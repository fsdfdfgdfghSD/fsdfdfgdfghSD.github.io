NAME
       palmtopnm - convert a Palm pixmap into a portable anymap

SYNOPSIS
       palmtopnm [-verbose] [-rendition N] [-showhist]
       [-forceplain] [pnmfile]
       palmtopnm -transparent [-verbose] [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a Palm pixmap as input, from stdin or pnmfile.  Produces either a portable pixmap as output, or writes the value of the transparent color in the Palm pixmap to stdout.

OPTIONS
       -verbose
              Display various interesting information about the input file and process.

       -transparent
              If  the Palm pixmap has a transparent color set, the RGB value for that color will be written to stdout as in the form #RRGGBB, where RR, GG, and BB are two-digit hexadecimal numbers indicating a value between
              0 and 255.  If no transparent color is set in the bitmap, nothing will be output.  No additional output will be generated; no anymap will be output.

       -rendition N
              Palm pixmaps may contain several different renditions of the same pixmap, with different depths.  By default, palmtopnm operates on the first rendition (rendition number 1) in the pixmap.  This  switch  allows
              you to operate on a different rendition.  The value must be between 1 and the number of renditions in the pixmap, inclusive.

       -showhist
              Writes a histogram of colors in the input file to stderr.

       -forceplain
              Force the output anymap to be in ASCII 'plain' netpbm format.

BUGS
       An additional compression format, "packbits," has been added with PalmOS 4.0.  This package should be updated to handle it.

       You currently cannot generate an alpha mask if the Palm pixmap has a transparent color.  However, you can still do this with ppmcolormask with a Netpbm pipe similar to:

       palmtopnm pixmap.palm | ppmcolormask `palmtopnm -transparent pixmap.palm`
