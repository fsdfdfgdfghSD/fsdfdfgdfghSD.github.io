NAME
       ed - line-oriented text editor

SYNOPSIS
       ed [options] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       GNU  ed is a line-oriented text editor. It is used to create, display, modify and otherwise manipulate text files, both interactively and via shell scripts. A restricted version of ed, red, can only edit files in the
       current directory and cannot execute shell commands. Ed is the 'standard' text editor in the sense that it is the original editor for Unix, and thus widely available. For most purposes, however, it is  superseded  by
       full-screen editors such as GNU Emacs or GNU Moe.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -V, --version
              output version information and exit

       -E, --extended-regexp
              use extended regular expressions

       -G, --traditional
              run in compatibility mode

       -l, --loose-exit-status
              exit with 0 status even if a command fails

       -p, --prompt=STRING
              use STRING as an interactive prompt

       -r, --restricted
              run in restricted mode

       -s, --quiet, --silent
              suppress diagnostics, byte counts and '!' prompt

       -v, --verbose
              be verbose; equivalent to the 'H' command

       --strip-trailing-cr
              strip carriage returns at end of text lines

       Start edit by reading in 'file' if given.  If 'file' begins with a '!', read output of shell command.

       Exit  status:  0  for a normal exit, 1 for environmental problems (file not found, invalid flags, I/O errors, etc), 2 to indicate a corrupt or invalid input file, 3 for an internal consistency error (e.g., bug) which
       caused ed to panic.
