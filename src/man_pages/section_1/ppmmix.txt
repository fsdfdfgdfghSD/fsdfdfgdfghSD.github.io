NAME
       ppmmix - blend together two portable pixmaps

SYNOPSIS
       ppmmix fadefactor ppmfile1 ppmfile2

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  two  portable  pixmaps as input. Mixes them together using the specified fade factor. The fade factor may be in the range from 0.0 (only ppmfile1's image data) to 1.0 (only ppmfile2's image data).  Anything in
       between gains a smooth blend between the two images.

       The two pixmaps must have the same size.

       pnmcomp is a more general alternative.  It allows you to mix images of different size and to have the fade factor vary throughout the image (through the use of an alpha mask).
