NAME
       autoreconf - Update generated configuration files

SYNOPSIS
       autoreconf [OPTION]... [DIRECTORY]...

DESCRIPTION
       Run  'autoconf'  and, when needed, 'aclocal', 'autoheader', 'automake', 'autopoint' (formerly 'gettextize'), 'libtoolize', 'intltoolize', and 'gtkdocize' to regenerate the GNU Build System files in specified DIRECTO‐
       RIES and their subdirectories (defaulting to '.').

       By default, it only remakes those files that are older than their sources.  If you install new versions of the GNU Build System, you can make 'autoreconf' remake all of the files by giving it the '--force' option.

   Operation modes:
       -h, --help
              print this help, then exit

       -V, --version
              print version number, then exit

       -v, --verbose
              verbosely report processing

       -d, --debug
              don't remove temporary files

       -f, --force
              consider all generated and standard files obsolete

       -i, --install
              copy missing standard auxiliary files

       --no-recursive
              don't rebuild sub-packages

       -s, --symlink
              with -i, install symbolic links instead of copies

       -m, --make
              when applicable, re-run ./configure && make

       -W, --warnings=CATEGORY
              report the warnings falling in CATEGORY [syntax]

   Warning categories include:
       cross  cross compilation issues

       gnu    GNU coding standards (default in gnu and gnits modes)

       obsolete
              obsolete features or constructions (default)

       portability-recursive
              nested Make variables (default with -Wportability)

       extra-portability
              extra portability issues related to obscure tools

       syntax dubious syntactic constructs (default)

       unsupported
              unsupported or incomplete features (default)

       all    all the warnings

       no-CATEGORY
              turn off warnings in CATEGORY

       none   turn off all the warnings

       error  treat warnings as errors

   Library directories:
       -B, --prepend-include=DIR
              prepend directory DIR to search path

       -I, --include=DIR
              append directory DIR to search path

       The environment variables AUTOCONF, ACLOCAL, AUTOHEADER, AUTOM4TE, AUTOMAKE, AUTOPOINT, GTKDOCIZE, INTLTOOLIZE, LIBTOOLIZE, M4, and MAKE are honored.
