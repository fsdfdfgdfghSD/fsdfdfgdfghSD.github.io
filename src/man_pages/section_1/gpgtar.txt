NAME
       gpgtar - Encrypt or sign files into an archive

SYNOPSIS
       gpgtar [options] filename1 [ filename2, ... ] directory1 [ directory2, ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       gpgtar encrypts or signs files into an archive.  It is an gpg-ized tar using the same format as used by PGP's PGP Zip.

OPTIONS
       gpgtar understands these options:

       --create
              Put given files and directories into a vanilla ``ustar'' archive.

       --extract
              Extract all files from a vanilla ``ustar'' archive.

       --encrypt
       -e     Encrypt given files and directories into an archive.  This option may be combined with option --symmetric for an archive that may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase.

       --decrypt
       -d     Extract all files from an encrypted archive.

       --sign
       -s     Make a signed archive from the given files and directories.  This can be combined with option --encrypt to create a signed and then encrypted archive.

       --list-archive
       -t     List the contents of the specified archive.

       --symmetric
       -c     Encrypt with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase.  The default symmetric cipher used is AES-128, but may be chosen with the --cipher-algo option to gpg.

       --recipient user
       -r user
              Encrypt for user id user. For details see gpg.

       --local-user user
       -u user
              Use user as the key to sign with.  For details see gpg.

       --output file
       -o file
              Write the archive to the specified file file.

       --verbose
       -v     Enable extra informational output.

       --quiet
       -q     Try to be as quiet as possible.

       --skip-crypto
              Skip all crypto operations and create or extract vanilla ``ustar'' archives.

       --dry-run
              Do not actually output the extracted files.

       --directory dir
       -C dir Extract  the  files into the directory dir.  The default is to take the directory name from the input filename.  If no input filename is known a directory named ‘GPGARCH’ is used.  For tarball creation, switch
              to directory dir before performing any operations.

       --files-from file
       -T file
              Take the file names to work from the file file; one file per line.

       --null Modify option --files-from to use a binary nul instead of a linefeed to separate file names.

       --utf8-strings
              Assume that the file names read by --files-from are UTF-8 encoded.  This option has an effect only on Windows where the active code page is otherwise assumed.

       --openpgp
              This option has no effect because OpenPGP encryption and signing is the default.

       --cms  This option is reserved and shall not be used.  It will eventually be used to encrypt or sign using the CMS protocol; but that is not yet implemented.

       --set-filename file
              Use the last component of file as the output directory.  The default is to take the directory name from the input filename.  If no input filename is known a directory named ‘GPGARCH’ is used.  This  option  is
              deprecated in favor of option --directory.

       --gpg gpgcmd
              Use the specified command gpgcmd instead of gpg.

       --gpg-args args
              Pass the specified extra options to gpg.

       --tar-args args
              Assume  args  are standard options of the command tar and parse them.  The only supported tar options are "--directory", "--files-from", and "--null" This is an obsolete options because those supported tar op‐
              tions can also be given directly.

       --version
              Print version of the program and exit.

       --help Display a brief help page and exit.

EXAMPLES
       Encrypt the contents of directory ‘mydocs’ for user Bob to file ‘test1’:

         gpgtar --encrypt --output test1 -r Bob mydocs

       List the contents of archive ‘test1’:

         gpgtar --list-archive test1

DIAGNOSTICS
       The program returns 0 if everything was fine, 1 otherwise.
