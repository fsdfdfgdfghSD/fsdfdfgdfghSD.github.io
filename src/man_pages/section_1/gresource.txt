NAME
       gresource - GResource tool

SYNOPSIS
       gresource [--section SECTION] list FILE [PATH]

DESCRIPTION
       gresource offers a simple commandline interface to GResource. It lets you list and extract resources that have been compiled into a resource file or included in an elf file (a binary or a shared library).

       The file to operate on is specified by the FILE argument.

       If an elf file includes multiple sections with resources, it is possible to select which one to operate on with the --section option. Use the sections command to find available sections.

COMMANDS
       list
           Lists resources. If SECTION is given, only list resources in this section. If PATH is given, only list matching resources.

       details
           Lists resources with details. If SECTION is given, only list resources in this section. If PATH is given, only list matching resources. Details include the section, size and compression of each resource.

       extract
           Extracts the resource named by PATH to stdout. Note that resources may contain binary data.

       sections
           Lists sections containing resources. This is only interesting if FILE is an elf file.

       help
           Prints help and exits.
