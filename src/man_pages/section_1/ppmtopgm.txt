NAME
       ppmtopgm - convert a portable pixmap into a portable graymap

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtopgm [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable pixmap as input.  Produces a portable graymap as output.  The output is a "black and white" rendering of the original image, as in a black and white photograph.  The quantization formula used is .299
       r + .587 g + .114 b.

       Note that although there is a pgmtoppm program, it is not necessary for simple conversions from pgm to ppm , because any ppm program can read pgm (and pbm ) files automatically.  pgmtoppm  is  for  colorizing  a  pgm
       file.   Also, see ppmtorgb3 for a different way of converting color to gray.  And ppmdist generates a grayscale image from a color image, but in a way that makes it easy to differentiate the original colors, not nec‚Äê
       essarily a way that looks like a black and white photograph.

QUOTE
       Cold-hearted orb that rules the night
       Removes the colors from our sight
       Red is gray, and yellow white
       But we decide which is right
       And which is a quantization error.
