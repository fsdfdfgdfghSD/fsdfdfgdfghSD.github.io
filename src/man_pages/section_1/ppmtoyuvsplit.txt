NAME
       ppmtoyuvsplit - convert a portable pixmap into 3 subsampled raw YUV files

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtoyuvsplit basename [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  portable  pixmap as input.  Produces 3 raw files basename.Y, basename.U and basename.V as output.  These files are the subsampled raw YUV representation of the input pixmap, as required by the Stanford MPEG
       codec. The subsampling is done by arithmetic mean of 4 pixels colors into one. The YUV values are scaled according to CCIR.601, as assumed by MPEG.
