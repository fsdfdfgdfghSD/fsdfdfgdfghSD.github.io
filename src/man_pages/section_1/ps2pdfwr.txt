NAME
       ps2pdfwr - Convert PostScript to PDF without specifying CompatibilityLevel, using ghostscript

SYNOPSIS
       ps2pdfwr  [options...] {input.[e]ps|-} [output.pdf|-]

DESCRIPTION
       This wrapper script invokes gs(1) with following arguments

                                                                                                -q -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite

       as  well  as  the  appropriate  -dOutputFile argument, all preceded and followed by any command-line arguments. Finally, the security option -dSAFER is prepended before all the other options (This is now redundant as
       "SAFER" is now the default, but the option does no harm).

       The version-specific ps2pdf scripts all invoke this one with the addition of the respective compatibility level option.
