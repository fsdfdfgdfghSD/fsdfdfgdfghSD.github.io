NAME
       taskset - set or retrieve a process's CPU affinity

SYNOPSIS
       taskset [options] mask command [argument...]

       taskset [options] -p [mask] pid

DESCRIPTION
       The taskset command is used to set or retrieve the CPU affinity of a running process given its pid, or to launch a new command with a given CPU affinity. CPU affinity is a scheduler property that "bonds" a process to
       a given set of CPUs on the system. The Linux scheduler will honor the given CPU affinity and the process will not run on any other CPUs. Note that the Linux scheduler also supports natural CPU affinity: the scheduler
       attempts to keep processes on the same CPU as long as practical for performance reasons. Therefore, forcing a specific CPU affinity is useful only in certain applications.

       The CPU affinity is represented as a bitmask, with the lowest order bit corresponding to the first logical CPU and the highest order bit corresponding to the last logical CPU. Not all CPUs may exist on a given system
       but a mask may specify more CPUs than are present. A retrieved mask will reflect only the bits that correspond to CPUs physically on the system. If an invalid mask is given (i.e., one that corresponds to no valid
       CPUs on the current system) an error is returned. The masks may be specified in hexadecimal (with or without a leading "0x"), or as a CPU list with the --cpu-list option. For example,

       0x00000001
           is processor #0,

       0x00000003
           is processors #0 and #1,

       0xFFFFFFFF
           is processors #0 through #31,

       32
           is processors #1, #4, and #5,

       --cpu-list 0-2,6
           is processors #0, #1, #2, and #6.

       --cpu-list 0-10:2
           is processors #0, #2, #4, #6, #8 and #10. The suffix ":N" specifies stride in the range, for example 0-10:3 is interpreted as 0,3,6,9 list.

       When taskset returns, it is guaranteed that the given program has been scheduled to a legal CPU.

OPTIONS
       -a, --all-tasks
           Set or retrieve the CPU affinity of all the tasks (threads) for a given PID.

       -c, --cpu-list
           Interpret mask as numerical list of processors instead of a bitmask. Numbers are separated by commas and may include ranges. For example: 0,5,8-11.

       -p, --pid
           Operate on an existing PID and do not launch a new task.

       -V, --version
           Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

USAGE
       The default behavior is to run a new command with a given affinity mask:
           taskset mask command [arguments]

       You can also retrieve the CPU affinity of an existing task:
           taskset -p pid

       Or set it:
           taskset -p mask pid

PERMISSIONS
       A user can change the CPU affinity of a process belonging to the same user. A user must possess CAP_SYS_NICE to change the CPU affinity of a process belonging to another user. A user can retrieve the affinity mask of
       any process.
