NAME
       pnmcut - cut a rectangle out of a portable anymap

SYNOPSIS
       pnmcut [-left leftcol] [-right rightcol] [-top toprow] [-bottom bottomrow] [-width width] [-height height] [-pad] [-verbose] [ left top width height ] [pnmfile]

       All options may be abbreviated to the shortest unique prefix.

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a PBM, PGM, or PPM image as input.  Extracts the specified rectangle, and produces the same kind of image as output.

       There  are two ways to specify the rectangle to cut: arguments and options.  Options are easier to remember and read, more expressive, and allow you to use defaults.  Arguments were the only way available before July
       2000.

       If you use both options and arguments, the two specifications get mixed in an unspecified way.

       To use options, just code any mixture of the -left, -right, -top, -bottom, -width, and -height options.  What you don't specify defaults.  It is an error to overspecify, i.e. to specify all three  of  -left,  -right,
       and -width or -top, -bottom, and -height.

       To  use arguments, specify all four of the left, top, width, and height arguments.  left and top have the same effect as specifying them as the argument of a -left or -top option, respectively.  width and height have
       the same effect as specifying them as the argument of a -width or -height option, respectively, where they are positive.  Where they are not positive, they have the same effect as specifying one less than  the  value
       as the argument to a -right or -bottom option, respectively.  (E.g.  width = 0 makes the cut go all the way to the right edge).  Before July 2000, negative numbers were not allowed for width and height.

       Input is from Standard Input if you don't specify the input file pnmfile.

       Output is to Standard Output.

OPTIONS
       -left  The column number of the leftmost column to be in the output.  If a nonnegative number, it refers to columns numbered from 0 at the left, increasing to the right.  If negative, it refers to columns numbered -1
              at the right, decreasing to the left.

       -right The column number of the rightmost column to be in the output, numbered the same as for -left.

       -top   The row number of the topmost row to be in the output.  If a nonnegative number it refers to rows numbered from 0 at the top, increasing downward.  If negative, it refers to columns numbered -1 at the  bottom,
              decreasing upward.

       -bottom
              The row number of the bottom-most row to be in the output, numbered the same as for -top.

       -width The number of columns to be in the output.  Must be positive.

       -height
              The number of rows to be in the output.  Must be positive.

       -pad   If  the  rectangle you specify is not entirely within the input image, pnmcut fails unless you also specify -pad.  In that case, it pads the output with black up to the edges you specify.  You can use this op‚Äê
              tion if you need to have an image of certain dimensions and have an image of arbitrary dimensions.

              pnmpad can also fill an image out to a specified dimension, and gives you more explicit control over the padding.

       -verbose
              Print information about the processing to Standard Error.
