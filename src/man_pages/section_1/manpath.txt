NAME
       manpath - determine search path for manual pages

SYNOPSIS
       manpath [-qgdc?V] [-m system[,...]] [-C file]

DESCRIPTION
       If $MANPATH is set, manpath will simply display its contents and issue a warning.  If not, manpath will determine a suitable manual page hierarchy search path and display the results.

       The colon-delimited path is determined using information gained from the man-db configuration file â€“ (/etc/manpath.config) and the user's environment.

OPTIONS
       -q, --quiet
              Do not issue warnings.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -c, --catpath
              Produce a catpath as opposed to a manpath.  Once the manpath is determined, each path element is converted to its relative catpath.

       -g, --global
              Produce a manpath consisting of all paths named as "global" within the man-db configuration file.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If this system has access to other operating systems' manual hierarchies, this option can be used to include them in the output of manpath.  To include NewOS's manual page hierarchies use the option -m NewOS.

              The  system  specified  can  be  a combination of comma delimited operating system names.  To include the native operating system's manual page hierarchies, the system name man must be included in the argument
              string.  This option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANPATH
              If $MANPATH is set, manpath displays its value rather than determining it on the fly.

              See the SEARCH PATH section of manpath(5) for the default behaviour and details of how this environment variable is handled.

       SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the argument to the -m option.

FILES
       /etc/manpath.config  man-db configuration file.
