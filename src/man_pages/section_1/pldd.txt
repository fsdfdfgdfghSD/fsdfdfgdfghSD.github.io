NAME
       pldd - display dynamic shared objects linked into a process

SYNOPSIS
       pldd pid
       pldd option

DESCRIPTION
       The  pldd  command  displays  a list of the dynamic shared objects (DSOs) that are linked into the process with the specified process ID (PID).  The list includes the libraries that have been dynamically loaded using
       dlopen(3).

OPTIONS
       -?, --help
              Display a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Display a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display program version information and exit.

EXIT STATUS
       On success, pldd exits with the status 0.  If the specified process does not exist, the user does not have permission to access its dynamic shared object list, or no command-line arguments are supplied,  pldd  exists
       with a status of 1.  If given an invalid option, it exits with the status 64.

VERSIONS
       pldd is available since glibc 2.15.

CONFORMING TO
       The pldd command is not specified by POSIX.1.  Some other systems have a similar command.

NOTES
       The command

           lsof -p PID

       also shows output that includes the dynamic shared objects that are linked into a process.

       The  gdb(1)  info shared command also shows the shared libraries being used by a process, so that one can obtain similar output to pldd using a command such as the following (to monitor the process with the specified
       pid):

           $ gdb -ex "set confirm off" -ex "set height 0" -ex "info shared" \
                   -ex "quit" -p $pid | grep '^0x.*0x'

BUGS
       From glibc 2.19 to 2.29, pldd was broken: it just hung when executed.  This problem was fixed in glibc 2.30, and the fix has been backported to earlier glibc versions in some distributions.

       $ echo $$               # Display PID of shell
       1143
       $ pldd $$               # Display DSOs linked into the shell
