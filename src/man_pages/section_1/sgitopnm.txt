NAME
       sgitopnm - convert a SGI image file to a portable anymap

SYNOPSIS
       sgitopnm [-verbose] [-channel c] [SGIfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads an SGI image file as input.  Produces a PGM image for a 2-dimensional (1 channel) input file, and a PPM image for a 3-dimensional (3 or more channels) input file.

       Alternatively, produces a PGM image of any one of the channels in the input file.

OPTIONS
       -verbose
              Give some information about the SGI image file.

       -channel c
              Extract  channel  c  of the image as a PGM image.  Without this option, sgitopnm extracts the first 3 channels as a PPM image or, if the input has only 1 channel, extracts that as a PGM image, and if the input
              has 2 channels, fails.
