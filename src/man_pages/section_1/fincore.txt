NAME
       fincore - count pages of file contents in core

SYNOPSIS
       fincore [options] file...

DESCRIPTION
       fincore counts pages of file contents being resident in memory (in core), and reports the numbers. If an error occurs during counting, then an error message is printed to the stderr and fincore continues processing
       the rest of files listed in a command line.

       The default output is subject to change. So whenever possible, you should avoid using default outputs in your scripts. Always explicitly define expected columns by using --output columns-list in environments where a
       stable output is required.

OPTIONS
       -n, --noheadings
           Do not print a header line in status output.

       -b, --bytes
           Print the SIZE column in bytes rather than in a human-readable format.

       -o, --output list
           Define output columns. See the --help output to get a list of the currently supported columns. The default list of columns may be extended if list is specified in the format +list.

       -r, --raw
           Produce output in raw format. All potentially unsafe characters are hex-escaped (\x<code>).

       -J, --json
           Use JSON output format.

       -V, --version
           Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.
