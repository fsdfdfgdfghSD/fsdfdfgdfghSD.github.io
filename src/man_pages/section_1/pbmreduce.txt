NAME
       pbmreduce - read a portable bitmap and reduce it N times

SYNOPSIS
       pbmreduce [-floyd|-fs|-threshold ] [-value val] N [pbmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable bitmap as input.  Reduces it by a factor of N, and produces a portable bitmap as output.

       pbmreduce duplicates a lot of the functionality of pgmtopbm; you could do something like pnmscale | pgmtopbm, but pbmreduce is a lot faster.

       pbmreduce  can  be  used to "re-halftone" an image.  Let's say you have a scanner that only produces black&white, not grayscale, and it does a terrible job of halftoning (most b&w scanners fit this description).  One
       way to fix the halftoning is to scan at the highest possible resolution, say 300 dpi, and then reduce by a factor of three or so using pbmreduce.  You can even correct the brightness of an image, by using the  -value
       flag.

OPTIONS
       By default, the halftoning after the reduction is done via boustrophedonic Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion; however, the -threshold flag can be used to specify simple thresholding.  This gives better results when re‚Äê
       ducing line drawings.

       The -value flag alters the thresholding value for all quantizations.  It should be a real number between 0 and 1.  Above 0.5 means darker images; below 0.5 means lighter.

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
