NAME
       ppmtobmp - convert a portable pixmap into a BMP file

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtobmp [-windows] [-os2] [-bpp=bits_per_pixel] [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable pixmap as input.  Produces a Microsoft Windows or OS/2 BMP file as output.

OPTIONS
       All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix and you can use a double dash in place of the single dash, GNU-style.

       -windows
              Tells the program to produce a Microsoft Windows BMP file.  (This is the default.)

       -os2   Tells the program to produce an OS/2 BMP file.  (Before August 2000, this was the default).

       -bpp   This determines how many bits per pixel you want the BMP file to contain.  Only 1, 4, 8, and 24 are possible.  By default, ppmtobmp chooses the smallest number with which it can represent all the colors in the
              input image.  If you specify a number too small to represent all the colors in the input image, ppmtobmp tells you and terminates.  You can use ppmquant or ppmdither to reduce the number of colors in  the  im‚Äê
              age.

NOTES
       To get a faithful reproduction of the input image, the maxval of the input image must be 255.  If it is something else, ppmtobmp the colors in the BMP file may be slightly different from the colors in the input.

       Windows icons are not BMP files.  Use ppmtowinicon to create those.
