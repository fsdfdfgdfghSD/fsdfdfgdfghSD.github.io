NAME
       psfaddtable - add a Unicode character table to a console font

SYNOPSIS
       psfaddtable fontfile tablefile outfile

DESCRIPTION
       psfaddtable  takes  a  console font in .psf format given by fontfile and merges it with the Unicode character table given by tablefile to produce a font file with an embedded character table, which is written to out‐
       file.  An input file name of "-" denotes standard input, and an output file name of "-" denotes standard output.  If the fontfile already contains an embedded character table, it is ignored.

TABLE FILE FORMAT
       Each line in the tablefile should be either blank, contain a comment (preceded by #), or contain a sequence of numbers in either decimal (default), octal (preceded by 0), or hexadecimal (preceded by 0x) format, sepa‐
       rated  by  spaces  or tabs.  The first number on each line indicates the glyph slot in the font that is being referred to, this is between 0 and 0xff for a 256-character font and 0 and 0x1ff for a 512-character font.
       Any subsequent numbers on the same line are Unicodes matched by this specific glyph slot.  Instead of a single Unicode one may have a sequence of Unicodes separates by commas, to denote that  the  glyph  depicts  the
       corresponding composed symbol.  It is permissible to have multiple lines for the same glyph.
