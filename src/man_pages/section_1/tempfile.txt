NAME
       tempfile - create a temporary file in a safe manner

SYNOPSIS
       tempfile [-d DIR] [-p STRING] [-s STRING] [-m MODE] [-n FILE] [--directory=DIR] [--prefix=STRING] [--suffix=STRING] [--mode=MODE] [--name=FILE] [--help] [--version]

DESCRIPTION
       tempfile creates a temporary file in a safe manner.  It uses mkstemps(3) to choose the name and opens it with O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_EXCL.  The filename is printed on standard output.

       The directory in which to create the file might be searched for in this order:

       a) In case the environment variable TMPDIR exists and contains the name of an appropriate directory, that is used.

       b) Otherwise, if the --directory argument is specified and appropriate, it is used.

       c) Otherwise, P_tmpdir (as defined in <stdio.h>) is used when appropriate.

       d) Finally an implementation-defined directory (/tmp) may be used.

OPTIONS
       -d, --directory DIR
              Place the file in DIR.

       -m, --mode MODE
              Open the file with MODE instead of 0600.

       -n, --name FILE
              Use FILE for the name instead of tempnam(3).  The options -d, -p, and -s are ignored if this option is given.

       -p, --prefix STRING
              Use up to five letters of STRING to generate the name.

       -s, --suffix STRING
              Generate the file with STRING as the suffix.

       --help Print a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.

       --version
              Print version information on standard output and exit successfully.

RETURN VALUES
       An exit status of 0 means the temporary file was created successfully.  Any other exit status indicates an error.

BUGS
       Exclusive creation is not guaranteed when creating files on NFS partitions.  tempfile cannot make temporary directories.  tempfile is deprecated; you should use mktemp(1) instead.

EXAMPLE
       #!/bin/sh
       #[...]
       t=$(tempfile) || exit
       trap "rm -f -- '$t'" EXIT
       #[...]
       rm -f -- "$t"
       trap - EXIT
       exit
