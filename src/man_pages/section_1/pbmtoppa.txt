NAME
       pbmtoppa - convert PBM image to HP Printer Performance Architecture (PPA)

SYNOPSIS
       pbmtoppa

       [pbm_file [ppa_file]]

DESCRIPTION
       pbmtoppa  converts  page  images  in PBM format to Hewlett Packard's PPA (Printer Performance Architecture) format, which is the data stream format expected by some HP "Windows-only" printers including the HP Deskjet
       820C series, the HP DeskJet 720 series, and the HP DeskJet 1000 series.

       pbm_file is the file specification of the input file or - for Standard Input.  The default is Standard Input.

       The input file contains one or more PBM images, with each one being a single page.  Each image must have the exact dimensions of a page (at 600 pixels per inch in both directions).  Significantly, this is the  format
       the Ghostscript produces.

       ppa_file is the file specification of the output file or - for Standard Output.  The default is Standard Output.

       To print Postscript on an HP PPA printer, just use Ghostscript with the pbmraw (or pbm) device driver.

       You can generate a test page for use with this program with pbmpage.

       You can also set up a printer filter so you can submit PBM input directly to your print queue.  See the documentation for your print spooler for information on how to do that, or look in hp820install.doc for an exam‐
       ple lpd print filter for Postscript and text files.

       Sometimes, pbmtoppa generates a file which the printer will not print (because pbmtoppa's input is unprintable).  When this happens, all three lights blink to signal the error.  This is usually because there is mate‐
       rial outside of the printer's printable area.  To make the file print, increase the margins via pbmtoppa options or a configuration file.  See the CALIBRATION section below.

OPTIONS
       -v version
              printer version (720, 820, or 1000)

       -x xoff
              vertical offset adjustment in 1"/600

       -y yoff
              horizontal offset adjustment in 1"/600

       -t topmarg
              top margin in 1"/600    (default: 150 = 0.25")

       -l leftmarg
              left margin in 1"/600   (default: 150 = 0.25")

       -r rightmarg
              right margin in 1"/600  (default: 150 = 0.25")

       -b botmarg
              bottom margin in 1"/600 (default: 150 = 0.25")

       -s paper
              paper size: us or a4.  Default is us.

       -f cfgfile
              read parameters from configuration file cfgfile

       The -x and -y options accumulate.

       The -v option resets the horizontal and vertical adjustments to an internal default.

CONFIGURATION FILES
       You can use configuration files to specify parameters rather than use invocation options.  pbmtoppa processes the file /etc/pbmtoppa.conf, if it exists, before processing any options.  It then processes each configu‐
       ration file named by a -f option in order, applying the parameters from the configuration file as if they were invocation options used in the place of the -f option.

       Configuration files have the following format:

       #Comment
       key1 value1
       key2 value2
       [etc.]

       Valid keys are version, xoffset, yoffset, topmargin, leftmargin, rightmargin, bottommargin, papersize, or any non-null prefix of these words.  Valid values are the same as with the  corresponding  invocation  parame‐
       ters.

EXAMPLES
       Print a test pattern:

       pbmpage | pbmppa >/dev/lp1

       Print three pages:

       cat page1.pbm page2.pbm page3.pbm | pbmppa >/dev/lp1

       Print the Postscript file myfile.ps:

       gs -sDEVICE=rawpbm -q -dNOPAUSE -r600 \
          -sOutputFile=- myfile.ps \
       | pbmtoppa | lpr

CALIBRATION
       To  be able to print successfully and properly, you need to tell pbmtoppa an X and a Y offset appropriate for your printer to use when generating the page.  You can specify these offsets with the -x and -y invocation
       options or with the xoff and yoff parameters in a pbmtoppa configuration file.

       To determine the correct offsets, use the pbmpage program.

       If while trying to do this calibration, the printer refuses to print a page, but just blinks all three lights, specify large margins (e.g. 600 pixels -- one inch) via pbmpage invocation options while doing the  cali‐
       bration.

       For example:

       pbmpage | pbmtoppa >/dev/lp1
       or
       pbmpage | pbmtoppa | lpr -l
       (if your printer filter recognizes the '-l' (direct output) parameter).

       In  the test pattern, the grid is marked off in pixel coordinate numbers.  Unfortunately, these coordinates are probably cut off before the edge of the paper.  You'll have to use a ruler to estimate the pixel coordi‐
       nate of the left and top edges of the actual sheet of paper (should be within +/- 300, may be negative; there are 600 pixels per inch).

       Add these coordinates to the X and Y offsets by either editing the configuration file or using the -x and -y command-line parameters.

       When pbmtoppa is properly calibrated, the center mark should be in the center of the paper.  Also, the margins should be able to be as small as 1/4 inch without causing the printer to choke with 'blinking lights syn‐
       drome'.

REDHAT LINUX INSTALLATION
       RedHat  users  may  find  the  following  tip from Panayotis Vryonis <vrypan@hol.gr> helpful.  The same should work for the 820 and 1000, but it hasn't been tested.  Also, use the pbmraw GSDriver if you have it; it's
       faster.

       Here is a tip to intergrate HP720C support in RedHat's printtool:

       Install pbm2ppa. Copy pbm2ppa to /usr/bin.

       Edit "printerdb" (in my system it is found in /usr/lib/rhs/rhs-printfilters ) and append the following lines:

       ----------------------Cut here-----------------------
       StartEntry: DeskJet720C
         GSDriver: pbm
         Description: {HP DeskJet 720C}
         About: { \
               This driver supports the HP DeskJet 720C \
               inkjet printer. \
               It does does not support color printing. \
               IMPORTANT! Insert \
                    "- | pbm2ppa -" \
               in the "Extra GS Otions" field.\
             }
         Resolution: {600} {600} {}
       EndEntry ----------------------------------------------------

       Now you can add an HP720C printer just like any other, using printtool.

       pnm2ppa is not part of Netpbm, but does the same things as pbmtoppa except it also works with color and has lots more features.  See <http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=1322>.

       The file INSTALL-MORE in the pbmtoppa directory of the Netpbm source code contains detailed instructions on setting up a system to use pbmtoppa to allow convenient printing on HP PPA  printers.   It  was  written  by
       Michael Buehlmann.

       For information about the PPA protocol and the separately distributed pbm2ppa program from which pbmtoppa was derived, see <http://www.httptech.com/ppa>.
