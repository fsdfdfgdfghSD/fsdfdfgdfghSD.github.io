NAME
       byobu-quiet - Silence all of Byobu's status indicators and eliminate the hardstatus line

USAGE
       byobu-quiet [--undo]

DESCRIPTION
       byobu-quiet will disable ALL of Byobu's status indicators and eliminate the hardstatus line.

       Some administrators, in some environments, at some times may prefer a very minimal, quiet Byobu, without the potentially distracting status indicators and eye candy.  However, the window menu is preserved, as well as
       all of Byobu's keybindings and helper utilities.  To elminate the window list, use byobu-silent(1).
