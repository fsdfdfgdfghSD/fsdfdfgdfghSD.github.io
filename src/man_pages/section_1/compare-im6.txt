       Image Sequence Operators:

       Image Stack Operators:
         -delete indexes      delete the image from the image sequence

       Miscellaneous Options:
         -debug events        display copious debugging information
         -help                print program options
         -log format          format of debugging information
         -list type           print a list of supported option arguments
         -version             print version information

       By default, the image format of `file' is determined by its magic number.  To specify a particular image format, precede the filename with an image format name and a colon (i.e. ps:image) or specify the image type as
       the filename suffix (i.e. image.ps).  Specify 'file' as '-' for standard input or output.

       Two  images are considered similar if their difference according to the specified metric and fuzz value is 0, with the exception of the normalized cross correlation metric (NCC), where two images are considered simi‐
       lar when their normalized cross correlation is 1. The default metric is NCC.

       The compare program returns 2 on error, 0 if the images are similar, or a value between 0 and 1 if they are not similar.
