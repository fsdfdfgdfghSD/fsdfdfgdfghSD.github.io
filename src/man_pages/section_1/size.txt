NAME
       size - list section sizes and total size of binary files

SYNOPSIS
       size [-A|-B|-G|--format=compatibility]
            [--help]
            [-d|-o|-x|--radix=number]
            [--common]
            [-t|--totals]
            [--target=bfdname] [-V|--version]
            [objfile...]

DESCRIPTION
       The GNU size utility lists the section sizes and the total size for each of the binary files objfile on its argument list.  By default, one line of output is generated for each file or each module if the file is an
       archive.

       objfile... are the files to be examined.  If none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used instead.

OPTIONS
       The command-line options have the following meanings:

       -A
       -B
       -G
       --format=compatibility
           Using one of these options, you can choose whether the output from GNU size resembles output from System V size (using -A, or --format=sysv), or Berkeley size (using -B, or --format=berkeley).  The default is the
           one-line format similar to Berkeley's.  Alternatively, you can choose the GNU format output (using -G, or --format=gnu), this is similar to Berkeley's output format, but sizes are counted differently.

           Here is an example of the Berkeley (default) format of output from size:

                   $ size --format=Berkeley ranlib size
                      text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
                    294880   81920   11592  388392   5ed28 ranlib
                    294880   81920   11888  388688   5ee50 size

           The Berkeley style output counts read only data in the "text" column, not in the "data" column, the "dec" and "hex" columns both display the sum of the "text", "data", and "bss" columns in decimal and hexadecimal
           respectively.

           The GNU format counts read only data in the "data" column, not the "text" column, and only displays the sum of the "text", "data", and "bss" columns once, in the "total" column.  The --radix option can be used to
           change the number base for all columns.  Here is the same data displayed with GNU conventions:

                   $ size --format=GNU ranlib size
                         text       data        bss      total filename
                       279880      96920      11592     388392 ranlib
                       279880      96920      11888     388688 size

           This is the same data, but displayed closer to System V conventions:

                   $ size --format=SysV ranlib size
                   ranlib  :
                   section         size         addr
                   .text         294880         8192
                   .data          81920       303104
                   .bss           11592       385024
                   Total         388392

                   size  :
                   section         size         addr
                   .text         294880         8192
                   .data          81920       303104
                   .bss           11888       385024
                   Total         388688

       --help
           Show a summary of acceptable arguments and options.

       -d
       -o
       -x
       --radix=number
           Using one of these options, you can control whether the size of each section is given in decimal (-d, or --radix=10); octal (-o, or --radix=8); or hexadecimal (-x, or --radix=16).  In --radix=number, only the
           three values (8, 10, 16) are supported.  The total size is always given in two radices; decimal and hexadecimal for -d or -x output, or octal and hexadecimal if you're using -o.

       --common
           Print total size of common symbols in each file.  When using Berkeley or GNU format these are included in the bss size.

       -t
       --totals
           Show totals of all objects listed (Berkeley or GNU format mode only).

       --target=bfdname
           Specify that the object-code format for objfile is bfdname.  This option may not be necessary; size can automatically recognize many formats.

       -V
       --version
           Display the version number of size.

       @file
           Read command-line options from file.  The options read are inserted in place of the original @file option.  If file does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not removed.

           Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a backslash) may be
           included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The file may itself contain additional @file options; any such options will be processed recursively.
