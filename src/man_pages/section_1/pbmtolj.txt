NAME
       pbmtolj - convert a portable bitmap into HP LaserJet format

SYNOPSIS
       pbmtolj [-resolution N] [-float] [-noreset] [-packbits] [-delta] [-compress] [pbmfile] [-copies N]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a PBM image as input.  Produces HP LaserJet data as output.

       Note that there is no ljtopbm tool.

OPTIONS
       -resolution
              Specifies the resolution of the output device, in dpi.  Typical values are 75, 100, 150, 300, and 600.  The default is 75.

       -float Suppresses positioning information.  The default is to write the sequence ESC & l 0 E to the output file.

       -noreset
              Prevents pbmtolj from writing the reset sequences to the beginning and end of the output file.

       -packbits
              Enables use of TIFF packbits compression.

       -delta Enables use of delta-between-rows compression.

       -compress
              Enables use of both TIFF packbits, and delta-between-rows compression.

       -copies
              Specifies the the number of copies. The default is 1.  This option controls the "number of copies" printer control; pbmtolj generates only one copy of the image.

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
