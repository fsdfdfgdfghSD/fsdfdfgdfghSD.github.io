NAME
       pamdice - slice a Netpbm image into many horizontally and/or vertically

SYNOPSIS
       pamslice -outstem=filenamestem [-width=width] [-height=height] [-verbose] [filename]

       You can use the minimum unique abbreviation of the options.  You can use two hyphens instead of one.  You can separate an option name from its value with white space instead of an equals sign.

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a PAM, PBM, PGM, or PPM image as input.  Splits it horizontally and/or vertically into equal size pieces and writes them into separate files as the same kind of image.

       See the -outstem option for information on naming of the output files.

       The -width and -height options determine the size of the output pieces.

       pnmcat can rejoin the images.

OPTIONS
       -outstem=filenamestem
              This option determines the names of the output files.  Each output file is named filenamestem_y_x.type where filenamestem is the value of the -outstem option, x and y are the horizontal and vertical locations,
              respectively, in the input image of the output image, zero being the leftmost and top, and type is .pbm, .pgm, .ppm, or .pam, depending on the type of image.

       -width=width
              gives the width in pixels of the output images.  The rightmost pieces are smaller than this if the input image is not a multiple of width pixels wide.

       -height=height
              gives the height in pixels of the output images.  The bottom pieces are smaller than this if the input image is not a multiple of height pixels high.

       -verbose
              Print information about the processing to Standard Error.
