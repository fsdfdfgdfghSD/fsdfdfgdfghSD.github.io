NAME
       gpgcompose - Generate a stream of OpenPGP packets

SYNOPSIS
       gpgcompose [[OPTION [ARGS]] ... ]

       gpgcompose --help

       gpgcompose OPTION --help

DESCRIPTION
       gpgcompose generates a stream of OpenPGP packets, including some which can include other nested packets within a layer of encryption.  The syntax on the command line isn't stable enough to document currently, but ad‚Äê
       ditional hints and examples can be found from the command line using --help.

EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES
       gpgcompose is not capable of performing secret key operations on its own.  Creation of any OpenPGP object that requires secret key operations (e.g., --signature) will need to speak to an already-running gpg-agent.

FILES
       Occasionally, gpgcompose will need to look up existing public keys for reference (e.g., --public-key).  It will do so in ~/.gnupg/keyring.kbx, or in $GNUPGHOME/keyring.kbx if that variable is set.
