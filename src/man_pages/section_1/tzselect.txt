NAME
       tzselect - view timezones

SYNOPSIS
       tzselect

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page explains how you can use the tzselect utility to view the installed timezone. It comes handy when you want to know what time it is in other countries, or if you just wonder what timezones exist.

       tzselect  is  called without any parameters from the shell. It shows a list of about one dozen geographic areas one can roughly recognize as continents. After choosing a geographic area by number, a list of countries
       and cities in this area will be shown.

       You can press the Enter key to reprint the list. To choose a timezone, just press the number left to it.  If your input is invalid, the list will be reprinted.

       You may press Ctrl-C to interrupt the script at any time.

       Note that tzselect will not actually change the timezone for you. Use 'dpkg-reconfigure tzdata' to achieve this.
