NAME
       peekfd - peek at file descriptors of running processes

SYNOPSIS
       peekfd [-8,--eight-bit-clean] [-n,--no-headers] [-f,--follow] [-d,--duplicates-removed] [-V,--version] [-h,--help] pid [fd] [fd] ...

DESCRIPTION
       peekfd attaches to a running process and intercepts all reads and writes to file descriptors.  You can specify the desired file descriptor numbers or dump all of them.

OPTIONS
       -8     Do no post-processing on the bytes being read or written.

       -n     Do not display headers indicating the source of the bytes dumped.

       -c     Also dump the requested file descriptor activity in any new child processes that are created.

       -d     Remove duplicate read/writes from the output.  If you're looking at a tty with echo, you might want this.

       -v     Display a version string.

       -h     Display a help message.

FILES
       /proc/*/fd
              Not used but useful for the user to look at to get good file descriptor numbers.

ENVIRONMENT
       None.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The following diagnostics may be issued on stderr:

       Error attaching to pid <PID>
              An unknown error occurred while attempted to attach to a process, you may need to be root.

BUGS
       Probably lots.  Don't be surprised if the process you are monitoring dies.
