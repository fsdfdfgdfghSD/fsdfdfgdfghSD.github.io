NAME
       localedef - compile locale definition files

SYNOPSIS
       localedef [options] outputpath
       localedef --add-to-archive [options] compiledpath
       localedef --delete-from-archive [options] localename ...
       localedef --list-archive [options]
       localedef --help
       localedef --usage
       localedef --version

DESCRIPTION
       The  localedef program reads the indicated charmap and input files, compiles them to a binary form quickly usable by the locale functions in the C library (setlocale(3), localeconv(3), etc.), and places the output in
       outputpath.

       The outputpath argument is interpreted as follows:

       *  If outputpath contains a slash character ('/'), it is interpreted as the name of the directory where the output definitions are to be stored.  In this case, there is a separate output file for each locale category
          (LC_TIME, LC_NUMERIC, and so on).

       *  If the --no-archive option is used, outputpath is the name of a subdirectory in /usr/lib/locale where per-category compiled files are placed.

       *  Otherwise,  outputpath is the name of a locale and the compiled locale data is added to the archive file /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive.  A locale archive is a memory-mapped file which contains all the system-pro‐
          vided locales; it is used by all localized programs when the environment variable LOCPATH is not set.

       In any case, localedef aborts if the directory in which it tries to write locale files has not already been created.

       If no charmapfile is given, the value ANSI_X3.4-1968 (for ASCII) is used by default.  If no inputfile is given, or if it is given as a dash (-), localedef reads from standard input.

OPTIONS
   Operation-selection options
       A few options direct localedef to do something other than compile locale definitions.  Only one of these options should be used at a time.

       --add-to-archive
              Add the compiledpath directories to the locale archive file.  The directories should have been created by previous runs of localedef, using --no-archive.

       --delete-from-archive
              Delete the named locales from the locale archive file.

       --list-archive
              List the locales contained in the locale archive file.

   Other options
       Some of the following options are sensible only for certain operations; generally, it should be self-evident which ones.  Notice that -f and -c are reversed from what you might expect; that is, -f is not the same  as
       --force.

       -f charmapfile, --charmap=charmapfile
              Specify  the  file  that  defines the character set that is used by the input file.  If charmapfile contains a slash character ('/'), it is interpreted as the name of the character map.  Otherwise, the file is
              sought in the current directory and the default directory for character maps.  If the environment variable I18NPATH is set, $I18NPATH/charmaps/ and $I18NPATH/ are also searched  after  the  current  directory.
              The default directory for character maps is printed by localedef --help.

       -i inputfile, --inputfile=inputfile
              Specify  the  locale  definition file to compile.  The file is sought in the current directory and the default directory for locale definition files.  If the environment variable I18NPATH is set, $I18NPATH/lo‐
              cales/ and $I18NPATH are also searched after the current directory.  The default directory for locale definition files is printed by localedef --help.

       -u repertoirefile, --repertoire-map=repertoirefile
              Read mappings from symbolic names to Unicode code points from repertoirefile.  If repertoirefile contains a slash character ('/'), it is interpreted as the pathname of the repertoire map.  Otherwise, the  file
              is  sought  in the current directory and the default directory for repertoire maps.  If the environment variable I18NPATH is set, $I18NPATH/repertoiremaps/ and $I18NPATH are also searched after the current di‐
              rectory.  The default directory for repertoire maps is printed by localedef --help.

       -A aliasfile, --alias-file=aliasfile
              Use aliasfile to look up aliases for locale names.  There is no default aliases file.

       -c, --force
              Write the output files even if warnings were generated about the input file.

       -v, --verbose
              Generate extra warnings about errors that are normally ignored.

       --big-endian
              Generate big-endian output.

       --little-endian
              Generate little-endian output.

       --no-archive
              Do not use the locale archive file, instead create outputpath as a subdirectory in the same directory as the locale archive file, and create separate output files for locale categories in it.  This is  helpful
              to prevent system locale archive updates from overwriting custom locales created with localedef.

       --no-hard-links
              Do not create hard links between installed locales.

       --no-warnings=warnings
              Comma-separated list of warnings to disable.  Supported warnings are ascii and intcurrsym.

       --posix
              Conform strictly to POSIX.  Implies --verbose.  This option currently has no other effect.  POSIX conformance is assumed if the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.

       --prefix=pathname
              Set the prefix to be prepended to the full archive pathname.  By default, the prefix is empty.  Setting the prefix to foo, the archive would be placed in foo/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive.

       --quiet
              Suppress all notifications and warnings, and report only fatal errors.

       --replace
              Replace a locale in the locale archive file.  Without this option, if the locale is in the archive file already, an error occurs.

       --warnings=warnings
              Comma-separated list of warnings to enable.  Supported warnings are ascii and intcurrsym.

       -?, --help
              Print a usage summary and exit.  Also prints the default paths used by localedef.

       --usage
              Print a short usage summary and exit.

       -V, --version
              Print the version number, license, and disclaimer of warranty for localedef.

EXIT STATUS
       One of the following exit values can be returned by localedef:

       0      Command completed successfully.

       1      Warnings or errors occurred, output files were written.

       4      Errors encountered, no output created.

ENVIRONMENT
       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              The --posix flag is assumed if this environment variable is set.

              A colon-separated list of search directories for files.

EXAMPLES
       Compile the locale files for Finnish in the UTF-8 character set and add it to the default locale archive with the name fi_FI.UTF-8:

           localedef -f UTF-8 -i fi_FI fi_FI.UTF-8

       The  next  example  does the same thing, but generates files into the fi_FI.UTF-8 directory which can then be used by programs when the environment variable LOCPATH is set to the current directory (note that the last
       argument must contain a slash):

           localedef -f UTF-8 -i fi_FI ./fi_FI.UTF-8
