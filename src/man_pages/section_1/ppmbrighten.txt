NAME
       ppmbrighten - change an images Saturation and Value from an HSV map

SYNOPSIS
       ppmbrighten [-n] [-s <+- saturation>] [-v <+- value>] <ppmfile>

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable pixmap as input.  Converts the image from RGB space to HSV space and changes the Value by <+- value> as a percentage.  Likewise with the Saturation.  Doubling the Value would involve

       ppmbrighten -v 100

       to add 100 percent to the Value.

       The 'n' option normalizes the Value to exist between 0 and 1 (normalized).
