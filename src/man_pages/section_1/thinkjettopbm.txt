NAME
       thinkjettopbm - convert HP ThinkJet printer commands file to PBM

SYNOPSIS
       thinkjettopbm [-d] [thinkjet_file]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads HP ThinkJet printer commands from the standard input, or thinkjet_file if specified, and writes a PBM image to the standard output.  Text and non-graphics command sequences are silently ignored.

       The -d option turns on debugging messages which are written to the standard error stream.

BUGS
       Handles only a small subset of ThinkJet command sequences, but enough to convert screen images from older HP test equipment.

SEE ALSO
