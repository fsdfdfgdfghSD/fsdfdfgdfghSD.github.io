NAME
       pbput - compress and encode arbitrary files to pastebin.com

       pbputs - compress, encrypt, encode arbitrary files to pastebin.com

       pbget - decode and decompress arbitrary files from pastebin.com

SYNOPSIS
       pbput [FILENAME]

       cat foo | pbput

       pbputs [FILENAME] [GPG_USER]

       cat foo | pbputs [GPG_USER]

       pbget URL [DIRECTORY]

DESCRIPTION
       pbput is a program that can upload text files, binary files or entire directory structures to a pastebin, such as pastebin.com.

       pbget is a program that be used to retrieve content uploaded to a pastebin by pbput.

       pbputs  operates exactly like pbput, except it encrypts the data.  An optional GPG_USER argument is allowed, which will sign and encrypt the data to the target user in one's keyring (which could be oneself!).  Other‐
       wise, the user is prompted for a symmetric passphrase for encrypting the content with gpg(1) before uploading.  pbget will automatically prompt the receiving user for the pre-shared passphrase.

       pbput and pbputs can take its input either on STDIN, or as a FILENAME argument.
         - If STDIN is used, then the receiving user's pbget will simply paste the input on STDOUT.
         - If a FILENAME or DIRECTORY is passed as an argument, then it is first archived using tar(1) to preserve the file and directory attributes

       pbget takes a URL as its first, mandatory argument.  Optionally, it takes a DIRECTORY as a second parameter.  If the incoming data is in fact a file or file structure in a tar(1) archive, then that data will  be  ex‐
       tracted in the specified DIRECTORY.  If no DIRECTORY is specified, then a temporary directory is created using mktemp(1).

       In any case the uploaded/downloaded data is optionally tar(1) archived, always lzma(1) compressed, optionally gpg(1) encrypted, and always base64(1) encoded.  http://pastebin.com is used by default.
