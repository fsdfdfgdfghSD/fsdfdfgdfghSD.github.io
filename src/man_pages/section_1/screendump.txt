NAME
       screendump - dump the contents of a virtual console to stdout

SYNOPSIS
       screendump [ N ]

DESCRIPTION
       The screendump command dumps the contents of virtual console N , (or the current console if N is omitted) to standard out.

       Just saying
              cat /dev/vcsN
       has a similar effect.

NOTES
       For security reasons, screendump uses linux devices "virtual console screen" and "virtual console screen with attributes" to give access for screendump.

       Ensure these files exist, using

              cd /dev for i in 0 1 2 3 ...; do
                   mknod vcs$i c 7 $i
                   mknod vcsa$i c 7 `expr 128 + $i`
              done

       (filling in the ellipses) and give the device files appropriate permissions, or run screendump as root.
