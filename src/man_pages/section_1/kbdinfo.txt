NAME
       kbdinfo - obtain information about the status of a console

SYNOPSIS
       kbdinfo [-C DEVICE] getmode [text|graphics]

       kbdinfo [-C DEVICE] gkbmode [raw|xlate|mediumraw|unicode]

DESCRIPTION
       kbdinfo  is  an  interface  to  KDGETMODE,  GKBMODE, GKBMETA and GKBLED ioctls.  Its primary use case is to query the status of the given CONSOLE (or the currently active one, if no -C option is present) from a shell
       script.

       If the final value argument is not specified, kbdinfo will print the result of the desired ioctl to the standard output.  Otherwise, the given value is compared to the actual result, and the utility will exit with  a
       status code of 0 for a match, 1 otherwise.  No text is printed for this style of invocation.
