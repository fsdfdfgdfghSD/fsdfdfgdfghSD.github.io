NAME
       ppmhist - print a histogram of a portable pixmap

SYNOPSIS
       ppmhist [-hexcolor] [-noheader] [-map] [-nomap] [-sort={frequency,rgb}] [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a PPM image as input.  Generates a histogram of the colors in the image, i.e. a list of all the colors and how many pixels of each color are in the image.

OPTIONS
       -sort={frequency,rgb}
              The  -sort  option  determines  the  order in which the colors are listed in the output.  frequency means to list them in order of how pixels in the input image have the color, with the most represented colors
              first.  rgb means to sort them first by the intensity of the red component of the color, the of the green, then of the blue, with the least intense first.

              The default is frequency.

       -hexcolor
              Print the color components in hexadecimal.  Default is decimal.

       -noheader
              Do not print the column headings.

       -map   Generates a PPM file of the colormap for the image, with the color histogram as comments.

       -nomap Generates the histogram for human reading.  This is the default.
