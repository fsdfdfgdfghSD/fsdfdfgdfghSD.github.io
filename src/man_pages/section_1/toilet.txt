NAME
       TOIlet - display large colourful characters

SYNOPSIS
       toilet [ -hkostvSW ] [ -d fontdirectory ]
              [ -f fontfile ] [ -F filter ] [ -w outputwidth ]
              [ -I infocode ] [ -E format ] [ message ]

DESCRIPTION
       TOIlet prints text using large characters made of smaller characters. It is similar in many ways to FIGlet with additional features such as Unicode handling, colour fonts, filters and various export formats.

USAGE
       TOIlet either reads its input from the command line or from the standard input.

OPTIONS
       -f, --font <name>
              Use  the  given  font instead of the default value. Fonts are .flf or .tlf files stored in the /usr/share/figlet directory. Fonts are looked first in the font directory, then in the current directory. There is
              also a special built-in font called term that serves as a fallback if no font is available.

       -d, --directory <dir>
              Specify the directory in which to look for fonts. The default value is set at build time and usually defaults to /usr/share/figlet.

       -s, -S, -k, -W, -o
              Select character composition rules.  -S sets smushing (nicely merging glyphs), -k sets kerning (rendering subcharacters as close to each other as possible), -W renders characters at their  full  width  and  -o
              sets  overlapping  (glyphs  slightly overlap the previous one).  -s (default behaviour) uses the font's smushing information if any, otherwise forces overlapping, or does nothing if the glyph only has one sub‐
              character.

       -w, --width <width>
              Set the output width. By default, TOIlet will wrap its output at 80 character columns.

       -t, --termwidth
              Set the output width to the terminal width.

       -F, --filter <filters>
       -F, --filter list
       --gay, --metal
              Specify a list of filters to be applied to the output.  <filters> is a colon-separated list of filters such as crop:rotate:gay and the special argument list outputs a list of available filters.

              --gay and --metal are shortcuts to commonly used filters that are guaranteed to exist. Several -F flags can also be specified on the command line, in which case filters will be applied in order of appearance.

       -E, --export <format>
       -E, --export list
       --irc, --html
              Specify the output format. By default, TOIlet will output UTF-8 text using ANSI colour codes suitable for most terminals such as XTerm or rxvt.  <format> is the name of the export format as recognised by  lib‐
              caca. The special argument list outputs a list of available export formats.

              --irc and --html are shortcuts to commonly used export formats that are guaranteed to exist.

       -h, --help
              Display a short help message and exit.

       -I, --infocode <code>
              Print a FIGlet infocode. This flag is only here for FIGlet compatibility, see the figlet manpage for more information about it.

       -v, --version
              Output version information and exit.

EXAMPLES
       toilet Hello World

       toilet Hello | toilet

       tail -f /var/log/messages | toilet -f term --gay

BUGS
       FIGlet compatibility is not complete yet.
