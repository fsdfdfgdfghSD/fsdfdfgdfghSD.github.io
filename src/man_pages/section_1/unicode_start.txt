NAME
       unicode_start - put keyboard and console in unicode mode

SYNOPSIS
       unicode_start [font [umap]]

DESCRIPTION
       The unicode_start command will put the keyboard and console into Unicode (UTF-8) mode.

       For  the keyboard this means that one can attach 16-bit U+xxxx values to keyboard keys using loadkeys(1), and have these appear as UTF-8 input to user programs.  Also, that one can type hexadecimal Alt-xxxx using the
       numeric keypad, and again produce UTF-8.

       For the console this means that the kernel expects UTF-8 output from user programs, and displays the output accordingly.

       The parameter font is a font that is loaded. It should have a built-in Unicode map, or, if it hasn't, such a map can be given explicitly as second parameter.  When no font was specified, the current font is kept.

NOTE
       Unicode mode is a parameter with a value per virtual console.  However, usually the font and keymap is common to all consoles.
