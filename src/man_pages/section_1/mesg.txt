NAME
       mesg - display (or do not display) messages from other users

SYNOPSIS
       mesg [option] [n|y]

DESCRIPTION
       The mesg utility is invoked by a user to control write access others have to the terminal device associated with standard error output. If write access is allowed, then programs such as talk(1) and write(1) may
       display messages on the terminal.

       Traditionally, write access is allowed by default. However, as users become more conscious of various security risks, there is a trend to remove write access by default, at least for the primary login shell. To make
       sure your ttys are set the way you want them to be set, mesg should be executed in your login scripts.

       The mesg utility silently exits with error status 2 if not executed on terminal. In this case execute mesg is pointless. The command line option --verbose forces mesg to print a warning in this situation. This
       behaviour has been introduced in version 2.33.

ARGUMENTS
       n
           Disallow messages.

       y
           Allow messages to be displayed.

       If no arguments are given, mesg shows the current message status on standard error output.

OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
           Explain what is being done.

       -V, --version
           Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

EXIT STATUS
       The mesg utility exits with one of the following values:

       0
           Messages are allowed.

       1
           Messages are not allowed.

       >1
           An error has occurred.
