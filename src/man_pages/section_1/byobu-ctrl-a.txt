NAME
       byobu-ctrl-a - Configure Byobu's ctrl-a behavior

DESCRIPTION
       byobu-ctrl-a is an interactive program that allows a user to configure the behavior of the 'ctrl-a' key sequence.

       Traditional  GNU screen(1) uses ctrl-a as its escape character, while GNU emacs(1) uses ctrl-a to move the cursor to the beginning of the line.  This conflict has caused unending amounts of grief among Screen, Byobu,
       and Emacs-mode users.

       Thus, this program exists to allow each user to choose the behavior of ctrl-a in their local environment.
