NAME
       byobu-layout - Save and restore byobu-tmux layouts

USAGE
       byobu-layout [save|restore] [name]

DESCRIPTION
       byobu-layout will save and restore byobu-tmux(1) split window layouts.

       If 'name' is blank, it operates interactively.

       Note that this only works with Byobu when backed by tmux(1), and not screen(1).
