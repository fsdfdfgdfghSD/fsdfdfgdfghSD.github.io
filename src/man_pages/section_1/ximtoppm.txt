NAME
       ximtoppm - convert an Xim file into a portable pixmap

SYNOPSIS
       ximtoppm [--alphaout={alpha-filename,-}] [ximfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads an Xim file as input.  Produces a portable pixmap as output.  The Xim toolkit is included in the contrib tree of the X.V11R4 release.

OPTIONS
       --alphaout=alpha-filename
              ximtoppm creates a PGM (portable graymap) file containing the alpha channel values in the input image.  If the input image doesn't contain an alpha channel, the alpha-filename file contains all zero (transpar‚Äê
              ent) alpha values.  If you don't specify --alphaout, ximtoppm does not generate an alpha file, and if the input image has an alpha channel, ximtoppm simply discards it.

              If you specify - as the filename, ximtoppm writes the alpha output to Standard Output and discards the image.

              Actually, an Xim image can contain an arbitrary fourth channel -- it need not be an Alpha channel.  ximtoppm extracts any fourth channel it finds as described above; it doesn't matter if it is an alpha channel
              or not.

              See pnmcomp(1) for one way to use the alpha output file.

       All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
