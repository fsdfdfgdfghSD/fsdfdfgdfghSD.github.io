NAME
       pbmtomacp - convert a portable bitmap into a MacPaint file

SYNOPSIS
       pbmtomacp [-l left] [-r right] [-b bottom] [-t top] [pbmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable bitmap as input.  If no input-file is given, standard input is assumed.  Produces a MacPaint file as output.

       The  generated  file is only the data fork of a picture.  You will need a program such as mcvert to generate a Macbinary or a BinHex file that contains the necessary information to identify the file as a PNTG file to
       MacOS.

OPTIONS
       Left, right, bottom & top let you define a square into the pbm file, that must be converted.  Default is the whole file.  If the file is too large for a MacPaint-file, the bitmap is cut to fit from ( left, top ).

BUGS
       The source code contains comments in a language other than English.
