NAME
       col1 .. col9, NF - awk and print a column (based on the name of the program, 1-9)

SYNOPSIS
       col1 [SEPARATOR]

DESCRIPTION
       col1 is a simple script that conveniently splits and prints a given column, where the column to print is the name of the script program you're running (col1-col9).  col2-col9 are symlinks to col1; their behavior sim‚Äê
       ply changes based on the name called.

       NF can be used to print the last field.

       The program takes one optional argument, the input field separator (whitespace, by default).

EXAMPLES
       Rather than:
        mount | awk '{print $3}'

       Try:
        mount | col3

       Instead of:
        cat /etc/passwd | awk -F":" '{print $7}'

       You can just do:
        cat /etc/passwd | col7 :

       Or
        cat /etc/passwd | NF :
