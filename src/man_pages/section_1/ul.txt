NAME
       ul - do underlining

SYNOPSIS
       ul [options] [file...]

DESCRIPTION
       ul reads the named files (or standard input if none are given) and translates occurrences of underscores to the sequence which indicates underlining for the terminal in use, as specified by the environment variable
       TERM. The terminfo database is read to determine the appropriate sequences for underlining. If the terminal is incapable of underlining but is capable of a standout mode, then that is used instead. If the terminal
       can overstrike, or handles underlining automatically, ul degenerates to cat(1). If the terminal cannot underline, underlining is ignored.

OPTIONS
       -i, --indicated
           Underlining is indicated by a separate line containing appropriate dashes `-'; this is useful when you want to look at the underlining which is present in an nroff output stream on a crt-terminal.

       -t, -T, --terminal terminal
           Override the environment variable TERM with the specified terminal type.

       -V, --version
           Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variable is used:

       TERM
           The TERM variable is used to relate a tty device with its device capability description (see terminfo(5)). TERM is set at login time, either by the default terminal type specified in /etc/ttys or as set during
           the login process by the user in their login file (see setenv(3)).

HISTORY
       The ul command appeared in 3.0BSD.

BUGS
       nroff usually outputs a series of backspaces and underlines intermixed with the text to indicate underlining. No attempt is made to optimize the backward motion.
