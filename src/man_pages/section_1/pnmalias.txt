NAME
       pnmalias - antialias a portable anyumap.

SYNOPSIS
       pnmalias [-bgcolor color] [-fgcolor color] [-bonly] [-fonly] [-balias] [-falias] [-weight w] [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  portable  anymap  as  input,  and applies anti-aliasing to background and foreground pixels.  If the input file is a portable bitmap, the output anti-aliased image is promoted to a graymap, and a message is
       printed informing the user of the change in format.

OPTIONS
       -bgcolor colorb, -fgcolor colorf
              set the background color to colorb, and the foreground to color to colorf.  Pixels with these values will be anti-aliased. by default, the background color is taken to be black, and foreground color is assumed
              to be white.  The colors can be specified in five ways:

              o    A name, assuming that a pointer to an X11-style color names file was compiled in.

              o    An X11-style hexadecimal specifier: rgb:r/g/b, where r g and b are each 1- to 4-digit hexadecimal numbers.

              o    An X11-style decimal specifier: rgbi:r/g/b, where r g and b are floating point numbers between 0 and 1.

              o    For backwards compatibility, an old-X11-style hexadecimal number: #rgb, #rrggbb, #rrrgggbbb, or #rrrrggggbbbb.

              o    For  backwards  compatibility,  a triplet of numbers separated by commas: r,g,b, where r g and b are floating point numbers between 0 and 1.  (This style was added before MIT came up with the similar rgbi
                   style.)

              Note that even when dealing with graymaps, background and foreground colors need to be specified in the fashion described above.  In this case, background and foreground pixel values are taken to be the  value
              of the red component for the given color.

       -bonly, -fonly
              Apply anti-aliasing only to background (-bonly), or foreground (-fonly) pixels.

       -balias, -falias
              Apply anti-aliasing to all pixels surrounding background (-balias), or foreground (-falias) pixels.  By default, anti-aliasing takes place only among neighboring background and foreground pixels.

       -weight w
              Use w as the central weight for the aliasing filter.  W must be a real number in the range 0 < w < 1.  The lower the value of w is, the "blurrier" the output image is.  The default is w = 1/3.
