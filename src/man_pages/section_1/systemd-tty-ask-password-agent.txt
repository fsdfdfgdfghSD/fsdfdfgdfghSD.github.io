NAME
       systemd-tty-ask-password-agent - List or process pending systemd password requests

SYNOPSIS
       systemd-tty-ask-password-agent [OPTIONS...] [VARIABLE=VALUE...]

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-tty-ask-password-agent is a password agent that handles password requests of the system, for example for hard disk encryption passwords or SSL certificate passwords that need to be queried at boot-time or
       during runtime.

       systemd-tty-ask-password-agent implements the Password Agents Specification[1], and is one of many possible response agents which answer to queries formulated with systemd-ask-password(1).

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       --list
           Lists all currently pending system password requests.

       --query
           Process all currently pending system password requests by querying the user on the calling TTY.

       --watch
           Continuously process password requests.

       --wall
           Forward password requests to wall(1) instead of querying the user on the calling TTY.

       --plymouth
           Ask question with plymouth(8) instead of querying the user on the calling TTY.

       --console[=DEVICE]
           Ask question on TTY DEVICE instead of querying the user on the calling TTY. If DEVICE is not specified, /dev/console will be used.

       -h, --help
           Print a short help text and exit.

       --version
           Print a short version string and exit.

EXIT STATUS
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
