NAME
       xpmtoppm - convert an X11 pixmap into a portable pixmap

SYNOPSIS
       xpmtoppm [--alphaout={alpha-filename,-}] [-verbose] [xpmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads an X11 pixmap (XPM version 1 or 3) as input.  Produces a PPM file as output.

OPTIONS
       --alphaout=alpha-filename
              xpmtoppm  creates  a PBM file containing the transparency mask for the image.  If the input image doesn't contain transparency information, the alpha-filename file contains all white (opaque) alpha values.  If
              you don't specify --alphaout, xpmtoppm does not generate an alpha file, and if the input image has transparency information, xpmtoppm simply discards it.

              If you specify - as the filename, xpmtoppm writes the alpha output to Standard Output and discards the image.

              See pnmcomp(1) for one way to use the alpha output file.

       --verbose
              xpmtoppm prints information about its processing on Standard Error.

LIMITATIONS
       The support to XPM version 3 is limited. Comments can only be single lines and there must be for every pixel a default colorname for a color type visual.
