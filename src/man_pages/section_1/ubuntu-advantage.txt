NAME
       pro - Manage Ubuntu Pro services from Canonical

SYNOPSIS
       pro <command> [<args>]
       ua <command> [<args>]
       ubuntu-advantage <command> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
       Ubuntu  Pro  is a collection of services offered by Canonical to Ubuntu users. The Ubuntu Pro command line tool is used to attach a system to an Ubuntu Pro contract to then enable and disable services from Canonical.
       The available commands and services are described in more detail below.

COMMANDS
       attach [--no-auto-enable] [--attach-config=/path/to/file.yaml] <token>
              Connect an Ubuntu Pro support contract to this machine.

              The token parameter can be obtained from https://auth.contracts.canonical.com/.

              The --attach-config option can be used to provide a file with the token and optionally, a list of services to enable after attaching. The token parameter should not be used if this option is provided.  An  at‐
              tach config file looks like the following:
                  token: YOUR_TOKEN_HERE  # required
                  enable_services:        # optional list of service names to auto-enable
                      - esm-infra
                      - esm-apps
                      - cis

              The optional --no-auto-enable flag will disable the automatic enablement of recommended entitlements which usually happens immediately after a successful attach.

              The exit code can be:
                  0: on successful attach
                  1: in case of any error while trying to attach
                  2: if the machine is already attached

       collect-logs [-o <file>| --output <file>]
              Create a tarball with all relevant logs and debug data.

              The --output parameter defines the path to the tarball. If not provided, the file is saved as ua_logs.tar.gz in the current directory.

       detach Remove the Ubuntu Pro support contract from this machine. This also disables all enabled services that can be.

       disable [cc-eal|cis|esm-apps|esm-infra|fips|fips-updates|
               livepatch|realtime-kernel|ros|ros-updates]

              Disable this machine's access to an Ubuntu Pro service.

       enable [cc-eal|cis|esm-apps|esm-infra|fips|fips-updates|
              livepatch|realtime-kernel|ros|ros-updates]

              Activate and configure this machine's access to an Ubuntu Pro service.

       fix <security_issue>
              Fix a CVE or USN on the system by upgrading the appropriate package(s).

              <security_issue> can be any of the following formats: CVE-yyyy-nnnn, CVE-yyyy-nnnnnnn, or USN-nnnn-dd.

              The exit code can be 0, 1, or 2.
                  0: the fix was successfully applied
                  1: the fix cannot be applied
                  2: the fix was applied but requires a reboot before it takes effect

       refresh
              Refresh contract and service details from Canonical.

       security-status
              Show security updates for packages in the system, including all available ESM related content.

       status [--format=tabular|json|yaml] [--simulate-with-token TOKEN] [--all]
              Report current status of Ubuntu Pro services on system.

              This  shows whether this machine is attached to an Ubuntu Pro support contract. When attached, the report includes the specific support contract details including contract name, expiry dates, and the status of
              each service on this system.

              The attached status output has four columns:

              SERVICE: name of the service

              ENTITLED: whether the contract to which this machine is attached entitles use of this service. Possible values are: yes or no

              STATUS: whether the service is enabled on this machine.  Possible values are: enabled, disabled, n/a (if your contract entitles you to the service, but it isn't available for this machine) or — (if you  aren't
              entitled to this service)

              DESCRIPTION: a brief description of the service

              The unattached status output instead has three columns. SERVICE and DESCRIPTION are the same as above, and there is the addition of:

              AVAILABLE: whether this service would be available if this machine were attached.  The possible values are yes or no.

              If  --simulate-with-token  is  used, then the output has five columns.  SERVICE, AVAILABLE, ENTITLED and DESCRIPTION are the same as mentioned above, and AUTO_ENABLED shows whether the service is set to be en‐
              abled when that token is attached.

              If the --all flag is set, beta and unavailable services are also listed in the output.

       version
              Show version of the Ubuntu Pro package.

PRO UPGRADE DAEMON
       Ubuntu Pro client sets up a daemon on supported platforms (currently on Azure and GCP) to detect if an Ubuntu Pro license is purchased for the machine. If an Ubuntu Pro license is detected, then the machine is  auto‐
       matically attached.  If you are uninterested in Ubuntu Pro services, you can safely stop and disable the daemon using systemctl:

       sudo systemctl stop ubuntu-advantage.service sudo systemctl disable ubuntu-advantage.service

TIMER JOBS
       Ubuntu Pro client sets up a systemd timer to run jobs that need to be executed recurrently. The timer itself ticks every 5 minutes on average, and decides which jobs need to be executed based on their intervals.

       Jobs  are  executed by the timer script if the script has not yet run successfully, or their interval since last successful run is already exceeded.  There is a random delay applied to the timer, to desynchronize job
       execution time on machines spinned at the same time, avoiding multiple synchronized calls to the same service.

       Current jobs being checked and executed are:

       update_messaging
              Makes sure that the MOTD and APT messages match the available/enabled services on the system, showing information about available packages or security updates.

CONFIGURATION
       By default, Ubuntu Pro client configuration options are read from /etc/ubuntu-advantage/uaclient.conf.

       The following configuration options are available:

       contract_url
              The Ubuntu Pro contract server URL

       security_url
              The Ubuntu Pro security server URL

       data_dir
              Where Ubuntu Pro client stores its data files

       log_level
              The logging level used when writing to log_file

       log_file
              The log file for the Ubuntu Pro client cli

       The following options are set using the `pro config set` subcommand:

       http_proxy
              If set, pro will use the specified http proxy when making any http requests

       https_proxy
              If set, pro will use the specified https proxy when making any https requests

       apt_http_proxy
              [DEPRECATED] If set, pro will configure apt to use the specified http proxy by writing a apt config file to /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90ubuntu-advantage-aptproxy. (Please use global_apt_http_proxy)

       apt_https_proxy
              [DEPRECATED] If set, pro will configure apt to use the specified https proxy by writing a apt config file to /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90ubuntu-advantage-aptproxy. (Please use global_apt_https_proxy)

       global_apt_http_proxy
              If set, pro will configure apt to use the specified http proxy by writing a apt config file to /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90ubuntu-advantage-aptproxy. Set this if you prefer a global proxy for all resources, not just
              the ones from esm.ubuntu.com

       global_apt_https_proxy
              If  set,  pro  will  configure apt to use the specified https proxy by writing a apt config file to /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90ubuntu-advantage-aptproxy. Set this if you prefer a global proxy for all resources, not
              just the ones from esm.ubuntu.com

       ua_apt_http_proxy
              If set, pro will configure apt to use the specified http proxy by writing a apt config file to /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90ubuntu-advantage-aptproxy. This proxy is limited to accessing resources from esm.ubuntu.com

       ua_apt_https_proxy
              If set, pro will configure apt to use the specified https proxy by writing a apt config file to /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90ubuntu-advantage-aptproxy. This proxy is limited to accessing resources from esm.ubuntu.com

       <job_name>_timer
              Sets the timer running interval for a specific job. Those intervals are checked every time the systemd timer runs.

       If needed, authentication to the proxy server can be performed by setting username and password in the URL itself, as in:

         http_proxy: http://<username>:<password>@<fqdn>:<port>

       Additionally, some configuration options can be overridden in the environment by setting an environment variable prefaced by UA_<option_name>. Both uppercase and lowercase environment variables are allowed. The  con‐
       figuration options that support this are: data_dir, log_file, log_level, and security_url.

       For example, the following overrides the log_level found in uaclient.conf:

         UA_LOG_LEVEL=info pro attach

SERVICES
       Common Criteria EAL2 Provisioning (cc-eal)
              Enables and install the Common Criteria artifacts.

              The  artifacts  include  a configure script, a tarball with additional packages, and post install scripts. The artifacts will be installed in /usr/lib/common-criteria directory and the README and configuration
              guide are available in /usr/share/doc/ubuntu-commoncriteria directory.

       CIS Audit (cis)
              Enables and installs the CIS Audit artifacts.

       Expanded Security Maintenance (esm)
              Expanded Security Maintenance ensures the ongoing security and integrity of systems running Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS) releases through Ubuntu Pro for Infrastructure.

       FIPS 140-2 certified modules (fips)
              Install, configure, and enable FIPS 140-2 certified modules.

              After successfully enabling FIPS, the system MUST be rebooted. Failing to reboot will result in the system not running the updated FIPS kernel.

              Disabling FIPS is not currently supported.

       FIPS 140-2 certified modules with updates (fips-updates)
              Install, configure, and enable FIPS 140-2 certified modules with updates. Enabling FIPS with updates will take the system out of FIPS compliance as the updated modules are not FIPS certified.

              After successfully enabling FIPS with updates, the system MUST be rebooted. Failing to reboot will result in the system not running the updated FIPS kernel.

              Disabling FIPS with updates is not currently supported.

       Livepatch Service (livepatch)
              Automatically apply critical kernel patches without rebooting. Reduces downtime, keeping your Ubuntu LTS systems secure and compliant.
