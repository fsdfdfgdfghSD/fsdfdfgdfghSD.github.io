NAME
       lslogins - display information about known users in the system

SYNOPSIS
       lslogins [options] [-s|-u[=UID]] [-g groups] [-l logins] [username]

DESCRIPTION
       Examine the wtmp and btmp logs, /etc/shadow (if necessary) and /passwd and output the desired data.

       The optional argument username forces lslogins to print all available details about the specified user only. In this case the output format is different than in case of -l or -g and unknown is username reported as an
       error.

       The default action is to list info about all the users in the system.

OPTIONS
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --acc-expiration
           Display data about the date of last password change and the account expiration date (see shadow(5) for more info). (Requires root privileges.)

       --btmp-file path
           Alternate path for btmp.

       -c, --colon-separate
           Separate info about each user with a colon instead of a newline.

       -e, --export
           Output data in the format of NAME=VALUE.

       -f, --failed
           Display data about the users' last failed login attempts.

       -G, --supp-groups
           Show information about supplementary groups.

       -g, --groups=groups
           Only show data of users belonging to groups. More than one group may be specified; the list has to be comma-separated. Unknown group names are ignored.

           Note that relation between user and group may be invisible for primary group if the user is not explicitly specify as group member (e.g., in /etc/group). If the command lslogins scans for groups than it uses
           groups database only, and user database with primary GID is not used at all.

       -h, --help
           Display help information and exit.

       -L, --last
           Display data containing information about the users' last login sessions.

       -l, --logins=logins
           Only show data of users with a login specified in logins (user names or user IDS). More than one login may be specified; the list has to be comma-separated. Unknown login names are ignored.

       -n, --newline
           Display each piece of information on a separate line.

       --noheadings
           Do not print a header line.

       --notruncate
           Donâ€™t truncate output.

       -o, --output list
           Specify which output columns to print. The default list of columns may be extended if list is specified in the format +list.

       --output-all
           Output all available columns. --help to get a list of all supported columns.

       -p, --pwd
           Display information related to login by password (see also -afL).

       -r, --raw
           Raw output (no columnation).

       -s, --system-accs
           Show system accounts. These are by default all accounts with a UID between 101 and 999 (inclusive), with the exception of either nobody or nfsnobody (UID 65534). This hardcoded default may be overwritten by
           parameters SYS_UID_MIN and SYS_UID_MAX in the file /etc/login.defs.

       --time-format type
           Display dates in short, full or iso format. The default is short, this time format is designed to be space efficient and human readable.

       -u, --user-accs
           Show user accounts. These are by default all accounts with UID above 1000 (inclusive), with the exception of either nobody or nfsnobody (UID 65534). This hardcoded default maybe overwritten by parameters UID_MIN
           and UID_MAX in the file /etc/login.defs.

       -V, --version
           Display version information and exit.

       --wtmp-file path
           Alternate path for wtmp.

       --lastlog path
           Alternate path for lastlog(8).

       -Z, --context
           Display the users' security context.

       -z, --print0
           Delimit user entries with a nul character, instead of a newline.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           if OK,

       1
           if incorrect arguments specified,

       2
           if a serious error occurs (e.g., a corrupt log).

NOTES
       The default UID thresholds are read from /etc/login.defs.

HISTORY
       The lslogins utility is inspired by the logins utility, which first appeared in FreeBSD 4.10.
