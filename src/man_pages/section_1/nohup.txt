NAME
       nohup - run a command immune to hangups, with output to a non-tty

SYNOPSIS
       nohup COMMAND [ARG]...
       nohup OPTION

DESCRIPTION
       Run COMMAND, ignoring hangup signals.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If  standard input is a terminal, redirect it from an unreadable file.  If standard output is a terminal, append output to 'nohup.out' if possible, '$HOME/nohup.out' otherwise.  If standard error is a terminal, redi‐
       rect it to standard output.  To save output to FILE, use 'nohup COMMAND > FILE'.

       NOTE: your shell may have its own version of nohup, which usually supersedes the version described here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation for details about the options it supports.
