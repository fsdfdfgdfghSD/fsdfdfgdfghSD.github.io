NAME
       stdbuf - Run COMMAND, with modified buffering operations for its standard streams.

SYNOPSIS
       stdbuf OPTION... COMMAND

DESCRIPTION
       Run COMMAND, with modified buffering operations for its standard streams.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -i, --input=MODE
              adjust standard input stream buffering

       -o, --output=MODE
              adjust standard output stream buffering

       -e, --error=MODE
              adjust standard error stream buffering

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If MODE is 'L' the corresponding stream will be line buffered.  This option is invalid with standard input.

       If MODE is '0' the corresponding stream will be unbuffered.

       Otherwise  MODE  is  a number which may be followed by one of the following: KB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024, and so on for G, T, P, E, Z, Y.  Binary prefixes can be used, too: KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.  In
       this case the corresponding stream will be fully buffered with the buffer size set to MODE bytes.

       NOTE: If COMMAND adjusts the buffering of its standard streams ('tee' does for example) then that will override corresponding changes by 'stdbuf'.  Also some filters (like 'dd' and 'cat' etc.) don't use  streams  for
       I/O, and are thus unaffected by 'stdbuf' settings.

EXAMPLES
       tail -f access.log | stdbuf -oL cut -d ' ' -f1 | uniq
       This will immediately display unique entries from access.log

BUGS
       On GLIBC platforms, specifying a buffer size, i.e., using fully buffered mode will result in undefined operation.
