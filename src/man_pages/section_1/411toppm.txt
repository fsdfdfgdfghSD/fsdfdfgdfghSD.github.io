NAME
       411toppm - convert Sony Mavica .411 image to ppm

SYNOPSIS
       411toppm [-width width] [-height height] [411file]

       All options may be abbreviated to the shortest unique prefix.

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a .411 file, such as from a Sony Mavic camera, and converts it to a PPM image as output.

       Output is to Standard Output.

       The  originator  of  this  program and decipherer of the .411 format, Steve Allen <sla@alumni.caltech.edu>, has this to say about the utility of this program: "There's so little image in a 64x48 thumbnail (especially
       when you have the full size JPG file) that the only point in doing this was to answer the implicit challenge posed by the manual stating that only the camera can use these files."

OPTIONS
       -width The width (number of columns) of the input image.  Default is 64.

       -height
              The height (number of rows) of the input image.  Default is 48.
