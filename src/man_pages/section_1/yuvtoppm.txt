NAME
       yuvtoppm - convert Abekas YUV bytes into a portable pixmap

SYNOPSIS
       yuvtoppm width height [imagedata]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads raw Abekas YUV bytes as input.  Produces a portable pixmap as output.  The input file is just YUV bytes.  You have to specify the width and height on the command line, since the program obviously can't get them
       from the file.  The maxval is assumed to be 255.
