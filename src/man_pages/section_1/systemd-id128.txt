SYSTEMD-ID128(1)                                                                                         systemd-id128                                                                                         SYSTEMD-ID128(1)

NAME
       systemd-id128 - Generate and print sd-128 identifiers

SYNOPSIS
       systemd-id128 [OPTIONS...] new

       systemd-id128 [OPTIONS...] machine-id

       systemd-id128 [OPTIONS...] boot-id

       systemd-id128 [OPTIONS...] invocation-id

DESCRIPTION
       id128 may be used to conveniently print sd-id128(3) UUIDs. What identifier is printed depends on the specific verb.

       With new, a new random identifier will be generated.

       With machine-id, the identifier of the current machine will be printed. See machine-id(5).

       With boot-id, the identifier of the current boot will be printed.

       Both machine-id and boot-id may be combined with the --app-specific=app-id switch to generate application-specific IDs. See sd_id128_get_machine(3) for the discussion when this is useful.

       With invocation-id, the identifier of the current service invocation will be printed. This is available in systemd services. See systemd.exec(5).

       With show, well-known UUIDs are printed. When no arguments are specified, all known UUIDs are shown. When arguments are specified, they must be the names or values of one or more known UUIDs, which are then printed.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       -p, --pretty
           Generate output as programming language snippets.

       -a app-id, --app-specific=app-id
           With this option, an identifier that is the result of hashing the application identifier app-id and the machine identifier will be printed. The app-id argument must be a valid sd-id128 string identifying the
           application.

       -u, --uuid
           Generate output as an UUID formatted in the "canonical representation", with five groups of digits separated by hyphens. See the wikipedia[1] for more discussion.

       -h, --help
           Print a short help text and exit.

       --version
           Print a short version string and exit.

EXIT STATUS
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
