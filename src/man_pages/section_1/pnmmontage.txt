NAME
       pnmmontage - create a montage of portable anymaps

SYNOPSIS
       pnmmontage [-?|-help] [-header=headerfile] [-quality=n] [-prefix=prefix] [-0|-1|-2|...|-9] pnmfile...

DESCRIPTION
       Packs images of differing sizes into a minimum-area composite image, optionally producing a C header file with the locations of the subimages within the composite image.

OPTIONS
       -?, -help
              Displays a (very) short usage message.

       -header
              Tells  pnmmontage  to write a C header file of the locations of the original images within the packed image.  Each original image generates four #defines within the packed file: xxxX, xxxY, xxxSZX, and xxxSZY,
              where xxx is the name of the file, converted to all uppercase.  The #defines OVERALLX and OVERALLY are also produced, specifying the total size of the montage image.

       -prefix
              Tells pnmmontage to use the specified prefix on all of the #defines it generates.

       -quality
              Before attempting to place the subimages, pnmmontage will calculate a minimum possible area for the montage; this is either the total of the areas of all the subimages, or the  width  of  the  widest  subimage
              times the height of the tallest subimage, whichever is greater.  pnmmontage then initiates a problem-space search to find the best packing; if it finds a solution that is (at least) as good as the minimum area
              times the quality as a percent, it will break out of the search.  Thus, -q 100 will find the best possible solution; however, it may take a very long time to do so.  The default is -q 200.

       -0, -1, ... -9
              These options control the quality at a higher level than -q; -0 is the worst quality (literally pick the first solution found), while -9 is the best quality (perform an exhaustive search of problem  space  for
              the absolute best packing).  The higher the number, the slower the computation.  The default is -5.

NOTES
       Using  -9  is excessively slow on all but the smallest image sets.  If the anymaps differ in maxvals, then pnmmontage will pick the smallest maxval which is evenly divisible by each of the maxvals of the original im‚Äê
       ages.
