NAME
       pnmdepth - change the maxval in a portable anymap

SYNOPSIS
       pnmdepth newmaxval [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable anymap as input.  Scales all the pixel values, and writes out the image with the new maxval.  Scaling the colors down to a smaller maxval will result in some loss of information.

       Be careful of off-by-one errors when choosing the new maxval.  For instance, if you want the color values to be five bits wide, use a maxval of 31, not 32.

       One  important use of pnmdepth is to convert a new format 2-byte-per-sample PNM file to the older 1-byte-per-sample format.  Before April 2000, essentially all raw (binary) format PNM files had a maxval less than 256
       and one byte per sample, and many programs may rely on that.  If you specify a newmaxval less than 256, the resulting file should be readable by any program that worked with PNM files before April 2000.
