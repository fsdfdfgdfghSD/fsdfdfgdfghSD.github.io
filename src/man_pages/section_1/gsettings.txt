DESCRIPTION
       gsettings offers a simple commandline interface to GSettings. It lets you get, set or monitor an individual key for changes.

       The SCHEMA and KEY arguments are required for most commands to specify the schema id and the name of the key to operate on. The schema id may optionally have a :PATH suffix. Specifying the path is only needed if the
       schema does not have a fixed path.

       When setting a key, you also need specify a VALUE The format for the value is that of a serialized GVariant, so e.g. a string must include explicit quotes: "'foo'". This format is also used when printing out values.

       Note that gsettings needs a D-Bus session bus connection to write changes to the dconf database.

COMMANDS
       get
           Gets the value of KEY. The value is printed out as a serialized GVariant.

       monitor
           Monitors KEY for changes and prints the changed values. If no KEY is specified, all keys in the schema are monitored. Monitoring will continue until the process is terminated.

       writable
           Finds out whether KEY is writable.

       range
           Queries the range of valid values for KEY.

       describe
           Queries the description of valid values for KEY.

       set
           Sets the value of KEY to VALUE. The value is specified as a serialized GVariant.

       reset
           Resets KEY to its default value.

       reset-recursively
           Reset all keys under the given SCHEMA.

       list-schemas
           Lists the installed, non-relocatable schemas. See list-relocatable-schemas if you are interested in relocatable schemas. If [--print-paths] is given, the path where each schema is mapped is also printed.

       list-relocatable-schemas
           Lists the installed, relocatable schemas. See list-schemas if you are interested in non-relocatable schemas.

       list-keys
           Lists the keys in SCHEMA.

       list-children
           Lists the children of SCHEMA.

       list-recursively
           Lists keys and values, recursively. If no SCHEMA is given, list keys in all schemas.

       help
           Prints help and exits.
