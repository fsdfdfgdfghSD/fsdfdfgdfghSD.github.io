NAME
       paperconf - print paper configuration information

SYNOPSIS
       paperconf [ [ -p ] paper | -d | -a ] [ -z ] [ -n | -N ] [ -s | -w | -h ] [ -c | -m | -i ]

DESCRIPTION
       paperconf  prints  information  about  a given paper.  The information that can be obtained is the name of the paper, its size and its width or height.  When called without arguments, paperconf prints the name of the
       system- or user-specified paper, obtained by looking in order at the PAPERSIZE environment variable, at the contents of the file specified by the PAPERCONF environment variable, at the contents of  /etc/papersize  or
       by using letter as a fall-back value if none of the other alternatives are successful.  By default, width and height of the paper are printed in PostScript points.

OPTIONS
