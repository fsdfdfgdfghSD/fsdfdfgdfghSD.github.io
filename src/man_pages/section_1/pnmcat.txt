NAME
       pnmcat - concatenate portable anymaps

SYNOPSIS
       pnmcat [-white|-black] -leftright|-lr [-jtop|-jbottom] pnmfile pnmfile ...
       pnmcat [-white|-black] -topbottom|-tb [-jleft|-jright] pnmfile pnmfile ...

DESCRIPTION
       Reads portable anymaps as input.  Concatenates them either left to right or top to bottom, and produces a portable anymap as output.

       pamdice splits an image up into smaller ones.

       pnmtile concatenates a single input image to itself repeatedly.

OPTIONS
       If  the  anymaps  are not all the same height (left-right) or width (top-bottom), the smaller ones have to be justified with the largest.  By default, they get centered, but you can specify one side or the other with
       one of the -j* flags.  So, -topbottom -jleft would stack the anymaps on top of each other, flush with the left edge.

       The -white and -black flags specify what color to use to fill in the extra space when doing this justification.  If neither is specified, the program makes a guess.

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
