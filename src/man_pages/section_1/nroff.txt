NAME
       nroff - use groff to format documents for TTY devices

SYNOPSIS
       nroff [-CchipStUv] [-dcs] [-Mdir] [-mname] [-nnum] [-olist] [-rcn] [-Tname] [-Wwarning] [-wwarning] [file ...]

       nroff --help

       nroff -v
       nroff --version

DESCRIPTION
       nroff formats documents written in the roff(7) language for typewriter-like devices such as terminal emulators.

       GNU  nroff emulates the traditional Unix nroff command using groff(1).  nroff generates output via grotty(1), groff's TTY output device, which needs to know the character encoding scheme used by the terminal.  Conse‐
       quently, acceptable arguments to the -T option are ascii, latin1, utf8, and cp1047; any others are ignored.  If neither the GROFF_TYPESETTER environment variable nor the -T command-line option  (which  overrides  the
       environment variable) specifies a (valid) device, nroff consults the locale to select an appropriate output device.  It first tries the locale(1) program, then checks several locale-related environment variables; see
       “ENVIRONMENT”, below.  If all of the foregoing fail, -Tascii is implied.

       Whitespace is not permitted between an option and its argument.  The -h and -c options are equivalent to grotty's options -h (using tabs in the output) and -c (using the old output scheme instead of  SGR  escape  se‐
       quences).   The  -d,  -C,  -i,  -M, -m, -n, -o, -r, -w, and -W options have the effect described in troff(1).  In addition, nroff ignores -e, -q, and -s (which are not implemented in troff).  The options -p (pic), -t
       (tbl), -S (safer), and -U (unsafe) are passed to groff.  -v and --version show version information, while --help displays a usage message; all exit afterward.

ENVIRONMENT
       GROFF_TYPESETTER
              specifies the default output device for groff.

       GROFF_BIN_PATH
              is a colon-separated list of directories in which to search for the groff executable before searching in PATH.  If unset, /usr/bin is used.

       LC_ALL
       LC_CTYPE
       LANG
       LESSCHARSET
              are pattern-matched in this order for standard character encodings supported by groff in the event no -T option is given and GROFF_TYPESETTER is unset.

NOTES
       Character definitions in the file /usr/share/groff/1.22.4/tmac/tty-char.tmac are loaded to replace unrepresentable glyphs.
