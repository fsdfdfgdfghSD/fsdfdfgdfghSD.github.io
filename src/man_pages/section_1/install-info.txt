NAME
       install-info - update info/dir entries

SYNOPSIS
       install-info [OPTION]... [INFO-FILE [DIR-FILE]]

DESCRIPTION
       Add or remove entries in INFO-FILE from the Info directory DIR-FILE.  INFO-FILE and DIR-FILE are required unless the --info-file or --dir-file (or --info-dir) options are given, respectively.

OPTIONS
       --add-once
              add only to first matching section, not all.

       --align=COL
              start description of new entries at column COL.

       --calign=COL
              format second and subsequent description lines to start at column COL.

       --debug
              report what is being done.

       --delete
              delete existing entries for INFO-FILE from DIR-FILE; don't insert any new entries.

       --defsection=TEXT
              like --section, but only use TEXT if no sections are present in INFO-FILE (replacing "Miscellaneous").

       --description=TEXT
              the description of the entry is TEXT; used with the --name option to become synonymous with the --entry option.

       --dir-file=NAME
              specify file name of Info directory file; equivalent to using the DIR-FILE argument.

       --dry-run
              same as --test.

       --entry=TEXT
              insert TEXT as an Info directory entry, overriding any corresponding entry from DIR-FILE.  TEXT is written as an Info menu item line followed

       by zero or more extra lines starting with whitespace.
              If you specify more than one entry, all are added.  If you don't specify any entries, they are determined

              from information in the Info file itself.

       --help display this help and exit.

       --info-dir=DIR
              same as --dir-file=DIR/dir.

       --info-file=FILE
              specify Info file to install in the directory; equivalent to using the INFO-FILE argument.

       --item=TEXT
              same as --entry=TEXT.

       --keep-old
              do not replace entries, or remove empty sections.

       --maxwidth, --max-width=COL
              wrap description at column COL.

       --menuentry=TEXT
              same as --name=TEXT.

       --name=TEXT
              the name of the entry is TEXT; used with --description to become synonymous with the --entry option.

       --no-indent
              do not format new entries in the DIR file.

       --quiet
              suppress warnings.

       --regex=R
              put this file's entries in all sections that match the regular expression R (ignoring case).

       --remove
              same as --delete.

       --remove-exactly
              only remove if the info file name matches exactly; suffixes such as .info and .gz are not ignored.

       --section=SEC
              put entries in section SEC of the directory.  If you specify more than one section, all the entries

       are added in each of the sections.
              If you don't specify any sections, they are determined

       from information in the Info file itself;
              if nothing is available there, the --defsection value is used; if that is not specified, the final default is "Miscellaneous".

       --section R SEC
              equivalent to --regex=R --section=SEC --add-once.

       --silent
              suppress warnings.

       --test suppress updating of DIR-FILE.

       --version
              display version information and exit.
