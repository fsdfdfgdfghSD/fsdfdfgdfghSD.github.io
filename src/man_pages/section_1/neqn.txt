NAME
       neqn - format equations for ASCII output

SYNOPSIS
       neqn [eqn-options]

DESCRIPTION
       neqn invokes the eqn(1) command with the ascii output device.

       Note that eqn does not support low-resolution, typewriter-like devices (although it may work adequately for very simple input).
