NAME
       byobu-launcher-install - Byobu Launcher installation utility

SYNOPSIS
       byobu-launcher-install [-n|--no-logout]

DESCRIPTION
       byobu-launcher-install(1) is a simple utilty that will add a line to your $HOME/.profile file which launches byobu(1) any time you login through ssh(1) or on a console(4).

       By default, when users detach from the byobu(1) session they will also logout.  Users can change this behavior by adding the [-n|--no-logout] option when they run byobu-launcher-install(1).

       You can disable this behavior entirely at any time with the byobu-launcher-uninstall(1) utility.
