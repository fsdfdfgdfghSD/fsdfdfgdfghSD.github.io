NAME
       sldtoppm - convert an AutoCAD slide file into a portable pixmap

SYNOPSIS
       sldtoppm [-adjust] [-dir] [-height|-ysize s] [-info] [-lib|-Lib name] [-scale s] [-verbose] [-width|-xsize s] [slidefile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  an  AutoCAD®  slide file and outputs a portable pixmap.  If no slidefile is specified, input is read from standard input.  The ppmdraw library is used to convert the vector and polygon information in the slide
       file to a pixmap; see the file ppmdraw.h for details on this package.

OPTIONS
       -adjust
              If the display on which the slide file was created had non-square pixels, when the slide is processed with sldtoppm and the -adjust option is not present, the following warning will appear:
                Warning - pixels on source screen were non-square.
                Specifying -adjust will correct image width to compensate.
              Specifying the -adjust option causes sldtoppm to scale the width of the image so that pixels in the resulting portable pixmap are square (and hence circles appear as true circles, not ellipses).   The  scaling
              is  performed  in  the vector domain, before scan converting the objects.  The results are, therefore, superior in appearance to what you'd obtain were you to perform the equivalent scaling with pnmscale after
              the bitmap had been created.

       -dir   The input is assumed to be an AutoCAD slide library file.  A directory listing each slide in the library is printed on standard error.

       -height size
              Scales the image in the vector domain so it is size pixels in height.  If no -width or -xsize option is specified, the width will be adjusted to preserve the pixel aspect ratio.

       -info  Dump the slide file header on standard error, displaying the original screen size and aspect ratio among other information.

       -lib name
              Extracts the slide with the given name from the slide library given as input.  The specified name is converted to upper case.

       -Lib name
              Extracts the slide with the given name from the slide library given as input.  The name is used exactly as specified; it is not converted to upper case.

       -scale s
              Scales the image by factor s, which may be any floating point value greater than zero.  Scaling is done after aspect ratio adjustment, if any.  Since scaling is performed in the vector domain, before  rasteri‐
              sation, the results look much better than running the output of sldtoppm through pnmscale.

       -verbose
              Dumps the slide file header and lists every vector and polygon in the file on standard error.

       -width size
              Scales the image in the vector domain so it is size pixels wide.  If no -height or -ysize option is specified, the height will be adjusted to preserve the pixel aspect ratio.

       -xsize size
              Scales the image in the vector domain so it is size pixels wide.  If no -height or -ysize option is specified, the height will be adjusted to preserve the pixel aspect ratio.

       -ysize size
              Scales the image in the vector domain so it is size pixels in height.  If no -width or -xsize option is specified, the width will be adjusted to preserve the pixel aspect ratio.

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.

BUGS
       Only Level 2 slides are converted.  Level 1 format has been obsolete since the advent of AutoCAD Release 9 in 1987, and was not portable across machine architectures.

       Slide  library  items with names containing 8 bit (such as ISO) or 16 bit (Kanji, for example) characters may not be found when chosen with the -lib option unless sldtoppm has been built with character set conversion
       functions appropriate to the locale.  You can always retrieve slides from libraries regardless of the character set by using the -Lib option and specifying the precise name of library member.  Use the -dir option  to
       list the slides in a library if you're unsure of the exact name.
