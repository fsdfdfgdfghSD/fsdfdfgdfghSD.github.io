NAME
       asciitopgm - convert ASCII graphics into a portable graymap

SYNOPSIS
       asciitopgm [-d divisor] height width [asciifile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads ASCII data as input.  Produces a portable graymap with pixel values which are an approximation of the "brightness" of the ASCII characters, assuming black-on-white printing.  In other words, a capital M is very
       dark, a period is ver light, and a space is white.  Input lines which are fewer than width characters are automatically padded with spaces.

       The divisor argument is a floating-point number by which the output pixels are divided; the default value is 1.0.  This can be used to adjust the brightness of the graymap: for example, if the image is too  dim,  re‚Äê
       duce the divisor.

       In keeping with (I believe) Fortran line-printer conventions, input lines beginning with a + (plus) character are assumed to "overstrike" the previous line, allowing a larger range of gray values.

       This tool contradicts the message in the pbmtoascii manual: "Note that there is no asciitopbm tool - this transformation is one-way."

BUGS
       The table of ASCII-to-grey values is subject to interpretation, and, of course, depends on the typeface intended for the input.
