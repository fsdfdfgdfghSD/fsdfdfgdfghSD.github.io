DESCRIPTION
       elfedit updates the ELF header and program property of ELF files which have the matching ELF machine and file types.  The options control how and which fields in the ELF header and program property should be updated.

       elffile... are the ELF files to be updated.  32-bit and 64-bit ELF files are supported, as are archives containing ELF files.

OPTIONS
       The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are equivalent. At least one of the --output-mach, --output-type, --output-osabi, --output-abiversion, --enable-x86-feature and --disable-x86-feature
       options must be given.

       --input-mach=machine
           Set the matching input ELF machine type to machine.  If --input-mach isn't specified, it will match any ELF machine types.

           The supported ELF machine types are, i386, IAMCU, L1OM, K1OM and x86-64.

       --output-mach=machine
           Change the ELF machine type in the ELF header to machine.  The supported ELF machine types are the same as --input-mach.

       --input-type=type
           Set the matching input ELF file type to type.  If --input-type isn't specified, it will match any ELF file types.

           The supported ELF file types are, rel, exec and dyn.

       --output-type=type
           Change the ELF file type in the ELF header to type.  The supported ELF types are the same as --input-type.

       --input-osabi=osabi
           Set the matching input ELF file OSABI to osabi.  If --input-osabi isn't specified, it will match any ELF OSABIs.

           The supported ELF OSABIs are, none, HPUX, NetBSD, GNU, Linux (alias for GNU), Solaris, AIX, Irix, FreeBSD, TRU64, Modesto, OpenBSD, OpenVMS, NSK, AROS and FenixOS.

       --output-osabi=osabi
           Change the ELF OSABI in the ELF header to osabi.  The supported ELF OSABI are the same as --input-osabi.

       --input-abiversion=version
           Set the matching input ELF file ABIVERSION to version.  version must be between 0 and 255.  If --input-abiversion isn't specified, it will match any ELF ABIVERSIONs.

       --output-abiversion=version
           Change the ELF ABIVERSION in the ELF header to version.  version must be between 0 and 255.

       --enable-x86-feature=feature
           Set the feature bit in program property in exec or dyn ELF files with machine types of i386 or x86-64.  The supported features are, ibt, shstk, lam_u48 and lam_u57.

       --disable-x86-feature=feature
           Clear the feature bit in program property in exec or dyn ELF files with machine types of i386 or x86-64.  The supported features are the same as --enable-x86-feature.

           Note: --enable-x86-feature and --disable-x86-feature are available only on hosts with mmap support.

       -v
       --version
           Display the version number of elfedit.

       -h
       --help
           Display the command-line options understood by elfedit.

       @file
           Read command-line options from file.  The options read are inserted in place of the original @file option.  If file does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not removed.

           Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a backslash) may be
           included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The file may itself contain additional @file options; any such options will be processed recursively.
