NAME
       pnmsmooth - smooth out an image

SYNOPSIS
       pnmsmooth [-size width height] [-dump dumpfile] [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Smooths out an image by replacing each pixel with the average of its width X height neighbors.  It is implemented as a C progam that generates a PGM convolution matrix and then invokes pnmconvol.

OPTIONS
       -size width height
              Specifies  the  size  of  the  convolution  matrix.  Default size is a 3x3 matrix.  Width and height sizes must be odd.  Maximum size of convolution matrix is limited by the maximum value for a pixel such that
              (width * height * 2) must not exceed the maximum pixel value.

       -dump dumpfile
              Generates and saves the convolution file only.  Use of this option does not invoke pnmconvol.
