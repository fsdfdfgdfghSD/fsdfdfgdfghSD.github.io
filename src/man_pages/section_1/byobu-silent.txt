NAME
       byobu-silent- Silence all of Byobu's status indicators, eliminate the hardstatus line, and the window list

USAGE
       byobu-silent [--undo]

DESCRIPTION
       byobu-silent will disable ALL of Byobu's status indicators, eliminate the hardstatus line, and the window list.

       Some administrators, in some environments, at some times may prefer a very minimal, quiet Byobu, without the potentially distracting status indicators and eye candy.

       byobu-silent implies byobu-quiet.
