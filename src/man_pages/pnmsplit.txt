NAME
       pnmsplit - split a multi-image portable anymap into multiple single-image files

SYNOPSIS
       pnmsplit [pnmfile[ output_file_pattern]]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a Netpbm file as input.  Copies each image in the input into a separate file, in the same format.

       pnmfile is the file specification of the input file, or - to indicate Standard Input.  The default is Standard Input.

       output_file_pattern tells how to name the output files.  It is the file specification of the output file, except that the first occurence of "%d" in it is replaced by the image sequence number in unpadded ASCII deci‚Äê
       mal, with the sequence starting at 0.  If there is no "%d" in the pattern, pnmsplit fails.

       The default output file pattern is "image%d".

       Note that to do the reverse operation (combining multiple single-image PNM files into a multi-image one), there is no special Netpbm program.  Just use cat.
