NAME
       rawtoppm - convert raw RGB bytes into a portable pixmap

SYNOPSIS
       rawtoppm [-headerskip N] [-rowskip N] [-rgb|-rbg|-grb |-gbr|-brg|-bgr ] [-interpixel|-interrow] width height [imagedata]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  raw  RGB bytes as input.  Produces a portable pixmap as output.  The input file is just RGB bytes.  You have to specify the width and height on the command line, since the program obviously can't get them from
       the file.  The maxval is assumed to be 255.  If the resulting image is upside down, run it through pnmflip -tb .

OPTIONS
       -headerskip
              If the file has a header, you can use this flag to skip over it.

       -rowskip
              If there is padding at the ends of the rows, you can skip it with this flag.

       -rgb -rbg -grb -gbr -brg -bgr
              These flags let you specify alternate color orders.  The default is -rgb.

       -interpixel -interrow
              These flags let you specify how the colors are interleaved.  The default is -interpixel, meaning interleaved by pixel.  A byte of red, a byte of green, and a byte of blue, or whatever color  order  you  speci‐
              fied.   -interrow  means interleaved by row - a row of red, a row of green, a row of blue, assuming standard rgb color order.  An -interplane flag  - all the red pixels, then all the green, then all the blue -
              would be an obvious extension, but is not implemented.  You could get the same effect by splitting the file into three parts (perhaps using dd), turning each part into a PGM file with rawtopgm, and  then  com‐
              bining them with rgb3toppm.
