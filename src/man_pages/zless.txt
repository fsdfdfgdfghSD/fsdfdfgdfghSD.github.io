NAME
       zless - file perusal filter for crt viewing of compressed text

SYNOPSIS
       zless [ name ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Zless is a filter which allows examination of compressed or plain text files one screenful at a time on a soft-copy terminal.  It is the equivalent of setting the environment variable LESSOPEN to '|gzip -cdfq -- %s',
       and the environment variable LESSMETACHARS to '<space><tab><newline>;*?"()<>[|&^`#\$%=~', and then running less.  However, enough people seem to think that having the command zless available is important to be  worth
       providing it.

SEE ALSO
       zmore(1), less(1)

BUGS
       Zless  does  not  work with compressed data that is piped to it via standard input; it requires that input files be specified as arguments.  To read compressed data from a pipe, you can use ...|gunzip|less instead of
       ...|zless.
