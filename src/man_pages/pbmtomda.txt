NAME
       pbmtomda - convert a portable bitmap to a Microdesign .mda

SYNOPSIS
       pbmtomda [-d][-i][--] [ pbmfile ]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable bitmap file as input.  Reads from stdin if input file is omitted.  Produces a MicroDesign 2 area file (.MDA) as output.

OPTIONS
       -d     Halve the height of the output file, to compensate for the aspect ratio used in MicroDesign files.

       -i     Invert the colours used.

       --     End of options (use this if the filename starts with "-")

BUGS
       There's no way to produce files in MicroDesign 3 format. MD3 itself and mdatopbm(1) can read files in either format.
