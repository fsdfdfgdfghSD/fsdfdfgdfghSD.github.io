NAME
       ppmtopict - convert a portable pixmap into a Macintosh PICT file

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtopict [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable pixmap as input.  Produces a Macintosh PICT file as output.

       The  generated  file is only the data fork of a picture.  You will need a program such as mcvert to generate a Macbinary or a BinHex file that contains the necessary information to identify the file as a PICT file to
       MacOS.

       Even though PICT supports 2 and 4 bits per pixel, ppmtopict always generates an 8 bits per pixel file.

BUGS
       The picture size field is only correct if the output is to a file since writing into this field requires seeking backwards on a file.  However the PICT documentation seems to suggest that this field is  not  critical
       anyway since it is only the lower 16 bits of the picture size.
