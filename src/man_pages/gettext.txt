NAME
       gettext - translate message

SYNOPSIS
       gettext [OPTION] [[TEXTDOMAIN] MSGID]
       gettext [OPTION] -s [MSGID]...

DESCRIPTION
       The gettext program translates a natural language message into the user's language, by looking up the translation in a message catalog.

       Display native language translation of a textual message.

       -d, --domain=TEXTDOMAIN
              retrieve translated messages from TEXTDOMAIN

       -c, --context=CONTEXT
              specify context for MSGID

       -e     enable expansion of some escape sequences

       -n     suppress trailing newline

       -E     (ignored for compatibility)

       [TEXTDOMAIN] MSGID
              retrieve translated message corresponding to MSGID from TEXTDOMAIN

   Informative output:
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -V, --version
              display version information and exit

       If  the  TEXTDOMAIN parameter is not given, the domain is determined from the environment variable TEXTDOMAIN.  If the message catalog is not found in the regular directory, another location can be specified with the
       environment variable TEXTDOMAINDIR.  When used with the -s option the program behaves like the 'echo' command.  But it does not simply copy its arguments to stdout.  Instead those messages found in the selected cata‐
       log are translated.  Standard search directory: /usr/share/locale
