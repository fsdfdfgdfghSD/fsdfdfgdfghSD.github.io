NAME
       psfxtable - handle Unicode character tables for console fonts

SYNOPSIS
       psfxtable [-i infont] [-o outfont] [-it intable] [-ot outtable] [-nt]

DESCRIPTION
       psfxtable  handles  the  embedded Unicode character table for .psf format console fonts. It reads a font and possibly a table and writes a font and/or a table.  psfaddtable(1), psfgettable(1) and psfstriptable(1) are
       links to it.

       Each of the filenames infont, outfont, intable, and outtable may be replaced by a single dash (-), in which case standard input or standard output is used.  If no -i option is given, the font is  read  from  standard
       input.  If no -it or -o or -ot option is given, no input table is read or no output font or output table is written.

       By  default the output font (if any) will have a Unicode table when either the input font has one, or an explicit table (which overrides an input font table) has been provided.  The option -nt causes output of a font
       without table.  When outfont is requested it will get a psf1 header when infont has a psf1 header and intable does not have sequences and a psf2 header otherwise.
