NAME
       pgmtexture - calculate textural features on a portable graymap

SYNOPSIS
       pgmtexture [-d d] [pgmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable graymap as input.  Calculates textural features based on spatial dependence matrices at 0, 45, 90, and 135 degrees for a distance d (default = 1).  Textural features include:

              (1) Angular Second Moment,
              (2) Contrast,
              (3) Correlation,
              (4) Variance,
              (5) Inverse Difference Moment,
              (6) Sum Average,
              (7) Sum Variance,
              (8) Sum Entropy,
              (9) Entropy,
              (10) Difference Variance,
              (11) Difference Entropy,
              (12, 13) Information Measures of Correlation, and
              (14) Maximal Correlation Coefficient.

       Algorithm taken from:

BUGS
       The  program  can  run  incredibly slow for large images (larger than 64 x 64) and command line options are limited.  The method for finding (14) the maximal correlation coefficient, which requires finding the second
       largest eigenvalue of a matrix Q, does not always converge.
