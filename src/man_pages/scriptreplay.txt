NAME
       scriptreplay - play back typescripts, using timing information

SYNOPSIS
       scriptreplay [options] [-t] timingfile [typescript [divisor]]

DESCRIPTION
       This program replays a typescript, using timing information to ensure that output happens in the same rhythm as it originally appeared when the script was recorded.

       The replay simply displays the information again; the programs that were run when the typescript was being recorded are not run again. Since the same information is simply being displayed, scriptreplay is only
       guaranteed to work properly if run on the same type of terminal the typescript was recorded on. Otherwise, any escape characters in the typescript may be interpreted differently by the terminal to which scriptreplay
       is sending its output.

       The timing information is what script(1) outputs to file specified by --log-timing.

       By default, the typescript to display is assumed to be named typescript, but other filenames may be specified, as the second parameter or with option --log-out.

       If the third parameter or --divisor is specified, it is used as a speed-up multiplier. For example, a speed-up of 2 makes scriptreplay go twice as fast, and a speed-up of 0.1 makes it go ten times slower than the
       original session.

OPTIONS
       -I, --log-in file
           File containing script's terminal input.

       -O, --log-out file
           File containing script's terminal output.

       -B, --log-io file
           File containing script's terminal output and input.

       -t, --timing file
           File containing script's timing output. This option overrides old-style arguments.

       -T, --log-timing file
           This is an alias for -t, maintained for compatibility with script(1) command-line options.

       -s, --typescript file
           File containing script's terminal output. Deprecated alias to --log-out. This option overrides old-style arguments.

       -c, --cr-mode mode
           Specifies how to use the CR (0x0D, carriage return) character from log files. The default mode is auto, in this case CR is replaced with line break for stdin log, because otherwise scriptreplay would overwrite
           the same line. The other modes are never and always.

       -d, --divisor number
           Speed up the replay displaying this number of times. The argument is a floating-point number. It’s called divisor because it divides the timings by this factor. This option overrides old-style arguments.

       -m, --maxdelay number
           Set the maximum delay between updates to number of seconds. The argument is a floating-point number. This can be used to avoid long pauses in the typescript replay.

       --summary
           Display details about the session recorded in the specified timing file and exit. The session has to be recorded using advanced format (see script(1)) option --logging-format for more details).

       -x, --stream type
           Forces scriptreplay to print only the specified stream. The supported stream types are in, out, signal, or info. This option is recommended for multi-stream logs (e.g., --log-io) in order to print only specified
           data.

       -V, --version
           Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

EXAMPLES
           % script --log-timing file.tm --log-out script.out
           Script started, file is script.out
           % ls
           <etc, etc>
           % exit
           Script done, file is script.out
           % scriptreplay --log-timing file.tm --log-out script.out
