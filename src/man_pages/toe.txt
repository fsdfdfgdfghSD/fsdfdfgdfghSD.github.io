NAME
       toe - table of (terminfo) entries

SYNOPSIS
       toe [-v[n]] [-ahsuUV] file...

DESCRIPTION
       With  no  options,  toe  lists all available terminal types by primary name with descriptions.  File arguments specify the directories to be scanned; if no such arguments are given, your default terminfo directory is
       scanned.  If you also specify the -h option, a directory header will be issued as each directory is entered.

       There are other options intended for use by terminfo file maintainers:

       -a     report on all of the terminal databases which ncurses would search, rather than only the first one that it finds.

              If the -s is also given, toe adds a column to the report, showing (like conflict(1)) which entries which belong to a given terminal database.  An "*" marks entries which differ, and "+"  marks  equivalent  en‐
              tries.

              Without the -s option, toe does not attempt to merge duplicates in its report

       -s     sort the output by the entry names.

       -u file
              says  to  write  a  report to the standard output, listing dependencies in the given terminfo/termcap source file.  The report condenses the “use” relation: each line consists of the primary name of a terminal
              that has use capabilities, followed by a colon, followed by the whitespace-separated primary names of all terminals which occur in those use capabilities, followed by a newline

       -U file
              says to write a report to the standard output, listing reverse dependencies in the given terminfo/termcap source file.  The report reverses the “use” relation: each line consists of the primary name of a  ter‐
              minal that occurs in use capabilities, followed by a colon, followed by the whitespace-separated primary names of all terminals which depend on it, followed by a newline.

       -vn    specifies that (verbose) output be written to standard error, showing toe's progress.

              The optional parameter n is a number from 1 to 10, interpreted as for tic(1).  If ncurses is built without tracing support, the optional parameter is ignored.

       -V     reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and exits.

EXAMPLES
       Without sorting, the -a option reports all of the names found in all of the terminal databases found by the TERMINFO and TERMINFO_DIRS environment variables:

           MtxOrb204      20x4 Matrix Orbital LCD display
           MtxOrb         Generic Matrix Orbital LCD display
           qvt101+        qume qvt 101 PLUS product
           qvt119+-25     QVT 119 PLUS with 25 data lines
           qansi-g        QNX ANSI
           qvt103         qume qvt 103
           qnxw           QNX4 windows
           qansi-w        QNX ansi for windows
           qnxm           QNX4 with mouse events
           qvt203-25-w    QVT 203 PLUS with 25 by 132 columns
           qansi-t        QNX ansi without console writes
           . . .

       Use the -a and -s options together to show where each terminal description was found:

           --> /usr/local/ncurses/share/terminfo
           ----> /usr/share/terminfo

           *---:     Eterm          Eterm with xterm-style color support (X Window System)
           *-*-:     Eterm-256color Eterm with xterm 256-colors
           *-*-:     Eterm-88color  Eterm with 88 colors

FILES
       /etc/terminfo/?/*
            Compiled terminal description database.

HISTORY
       This utility is not provided by other implementations.  There is no relevant X/Open or POSIX standard for toe.

       The program name refers to a developer's pun:

       •   tic,

       •   tac (now tack),

       •   toe.

       It replaced a -T option which was briefly supported by the ncurses infocmp utility in 1995.

       The -a and -s options were added to toe several years later (2006 and 2011, respectively).

SEE ALSO

       This describes ncurses version 6.3 (patch 20211021).
