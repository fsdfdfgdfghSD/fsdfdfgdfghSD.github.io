NAME
       BusyBox - The Swiss Army Knife of Embedded Linux

SYNTAX
        busybox <applet> [arguments...]  # or

        <applet> [arguments...]          # if symlinked

DESCRIPTION
       BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for most of the utilities you usually find in GNU coreutils, util-linux, etc. The
       utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU counterparts.

       BusyBox has been written with size-optimization and limited resources in mind.  It is also extremely modular so you can easily include or exclude commands (or features) at compile time. This makes it easy to
       customize your embedded systems. To create a working system, just add /dev, /etc, and a Linux kernel.  BusyBox provides a fairly complete POSIX environment for any small or embedded system.

       BusyBox is extremely configurable.  This allows you to include only the components you need, thereby reducing binary size. Run 'make config' or 'make menuconfig' to select the functionality that you wish to enable.
       Then run 'make' to compile BusyBox using your configuration.

       After the compile has finished, you should use 'make install' to install BusyBox. This will install the 'bin/busybox' binary, in the target directory specified by CONFIG_PREFIX. CONFIG_PREFIX can be set when
       configuring BusyBox, or you can specify an alternative location at install time (i.e., with a command line like 'make CONFIG_PREFIX=/tmp/foo install'). If you enabled any applet installation scheme (either as
       symlinks or hardlinks), these will also be installed in the location pointed to by CONFIG_PREFIX.

USAGE
       BusyBox is a multi-call binary.  A multi-call binary is an executable program that performs the same job as more than one utility program.  That means there is just a single BusyBox binary, but that single binary
       acts like a large number of utilities.  This allows BusyBox to be smaller since all the built-in utility programs (we call them applets) can share code for many common operations.

       You can also invoke BusyBox by issuing a command as an argument on the command line.  For example, entering

               /bin/busybox ls

       will also cause BusyBox to behave as 'ls'.

       Of course, adding '/bin/busybox' into every command would be painful.  So most people will invoke BusyBox using links to the BusyBox binary.

       For example, entering

               ln -s /bin/busybox ls
               ./ls

       will cause BusyBox to behave as 'ls' (if the 'ls' command has been compiled into BusyBox).  Generally speaking, you should never need to make all these links yourself, as the BusyBox build system will do this for you
       when you run the 'make install' command.

       If you invoke BusyBox with no arguments, it will provide you with a list of the applets that have been compiled into your BusyBox binary.

COMMON OPTIONS
       Most BusyBox applets support the --help argument to provide a terse runtime description of their behavior.  If the CONFIG_FEATURE_VERBOSE_USAGE option has been enabled, more detailed usage information will also be
       available.

                   ARG1 & ARG2     ARG1 if neither argument is null or 0, otherwise 0
                   ARG1 < ARG2     1 if ARG1 is less than ARG2, else 0. Similarly:
                   ARG1 <= ARG2
                   ARG1 = ARG2
                   ARG1 != ARG2
                   ARG1 >= ARG2
                   ARG1 > ARG2

                   STRING : REGEXP         Anchored pattern match of REGEXP in STRING
                   match STRING REGEXP     Same as STRING : REGEXP

                   index STRING CHARS      Index in STRING where any CHARS is found, or 0
                   length STRING           Length of STRING
                   quote TOKEN             Interpret TOKEN as a string, even if
                                           it is a keyword like 'match' or an
                                           operator like '/'
                   (EXPRESSION)            Value of EXPRESSION

           Beware that many operators need to be escaped or quoted for shells.  Comparisons are arithmetic if both ARGs are numbers, else lexicographical. Pattern matches return the string matched between \( and \) or null;
           if \( and \) are not used, they return the number of characters matched or 0.

       mdev
           mdev [-s]

           mdev -s is to be run during boot to scan /sys and populate /dev.

           Bare mdev is a kernel hotplug helper. To activate it:      echo /sbin/mdev >/proc/sys/kernel/hotplug

           It uses /etc/mdev.conf with lines      [-][ENV=regex;]...DEVNAME UID:GID PERM [>|=PATH]|[!] [@|$|*PROG] where DEVNAME is device name regex, @major,minor[-minor2], or environment variable regex. A common use of
           the latter is to load modules for hotplugged devices:

                   $MODALIAS=.* 0:0 660 @modprobe "$MODALIAS"

           If /dev/mdev.seq file exists, mdev will wait for its value to match $SEQNUM variable. This prevents plug/unplug races.  To activate this feature, create empty /dev/mdev.seq at boot.

           If /dev/mdev.log file exists, debug log will be appended to it.

LIBC NSS
       GNU Libc (glibc) uses the Name Service Switch (NSS) to configure the behavior of the C library for the local environment, and to configure how it reads system data, such as passwords and group information.  This is
       implemented using an /etc/nsswitch.conf configuration file, and using one or more of the /lib/libnss_* libraries.  BusyBox tries to avoid using any libc calls that make use of NSS.  Some applets however, such as
       login and su, will use libc functions that require NSS.

       If you enable CONFIG_USE_BB_PWD_GRP, BusyBox will use internal functions to directly access the /etc/passwd, /etc/group, and /etc/shadow files without using NSS.  This may allow you to run your system without the
       need for installing any of the NSS configuration files and libraries.

       When used with glibc, the BusyBox 'networking' applets will similarly require that you install at least some of the glibc NSS stuff (in particular, /etc/nsswitch.conf, /lib/libnss_dns*, /lib/libnss_files*, and
       /lib/libresolv*).

       Shameless Plug: As an alternative, one could use a C library such as uClibc.  In addition to making your system significantly smaller, uClibc does not require the use of any NSS support files or libraries.

           Tons of new stuff, major rewrite of most of the
           core apps, tons of new apps as noted in header files.
           Lots of tedious effort writing these boring docs that
           nobody is going to actually read.
