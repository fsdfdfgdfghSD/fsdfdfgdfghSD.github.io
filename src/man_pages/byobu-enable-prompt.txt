NAME
       byobu-prompt, byobu-enable-prompt, byobu-disable-prompt - add and remove a nice color prompt to your shell configuration

SYNOPSIS
       byobu-prompt

       byobu-enable-prompt

       byobu-disable-prompt

DESCRIPTION
       Byobu  provides a special PS1 prompt command, compatible with Bash shells.  It will display the previous command's exit code, if it's not zero.  It will use 3 separate colors for the local username, hostname, and the
       current working directory.

       byobu-enable-prompt will add one line to your ~/.bashrc.

       You can safely remove the line from your ~/.bashrc, which ends in #byobu-prompt.

       byobu-disable-prompt will remove its color configuration from ~/.bashrc.

       byobu-prompt is an interactive wrapper of the previous two tools.

BUGS
       This is currently only compatible with bash(1).
