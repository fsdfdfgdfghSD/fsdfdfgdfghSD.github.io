NAME
       utmpdump - dump UTMP and WTMP files in raw format

SYNOPSIS
       utmpdump [options] filename

DESCRIPTION
       utmpdump is a simple program to dump UTMP and WTMP files in raw format, so they can be examined. utmpdump reads from stdin unless a filename is passed.

OPTIONS
       -f, --follow
           Output appended data as the file grows.

       -o, --output file
           Write command output to file instead of standard output.

       -r, --reverse
           Undump, write back edited login information into the utmp or wtmp files.

       -V, --version
           Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

NOTES
       utmpdump can be useful in cases of corrupted utmp or wtmp entries. It can dump out utmp/wtmp to an ASCII file, which can then be edited to remove bogus entries, and reintegrated using:

          utmpdump -r < ascii_file > wtmp

       But be warned, utmpdump was written for debugging purposes only.

   File formats
       Only the binary version of the utmp(5) is standardised. Textual dumps may become incompatible in future.

       The version 2.28 was the last one that printed text output using ctime(3) timestamp format. Newer dumps use millisecond precision ISO-8601 timestamp format in UTC-0 timezone. Conversion from former timestamp format
       can be made to binary, although attempt to do so can lead the timestamps to drift amount of timezone offset.

BUGS
       You may not use the -r option, as the format for the utmp/wtmp files strongly depends on the input format. This tool was not written for normal use, but for debugging only.
